The oilfield at Baba Gurgur, near Kirkuk, has been burning for at least four thousand years. It sits above fissures through which methane escapes from deep within the Earth’s crust, licking through gaps in the rocks and feeding the flames. Its name is Kurdish for ‘Father of Eternal Fire’, and it’s a possible site for the furnace into which Nebuchadnezzar casts Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, the Jews who refuse to worship his golden idol, and are saved by divine intervention. Kurdish women used to travel to Baba Gurgur from miles around to pray that their child would be a son.

Elsewhere, incandescent foetal sex rituals are on the rise. In Western cultures, ‘gender reveal’ events often involve setting off fireworks with pink or blue colorants. Last month, a spark from a gender reveal party in El Dorado, California set a neighbouring forest ablaze. Over the course of three weeks, the fire burned through 23,000 acres. A firefighter died tackling the blaze.

(…) That a ‘gender reveal’ party should be the cause of a catastrophic fire is symbolically fitting. The political scientist Cara Daggett has described the rise of ‘petro-masculinity’: a pining for traditional power dynamics and the economies in which they have thrived. Racism, sexism and climate change denial are buttresses against a crumbling world.

What Facebook does is it locates people. So if you want to locate people, because you want to say something heterodox, which you might get punished for if you shouted it aloud, you can quietly find and talk to them.

That’s not an unalloyed evil – this is how we got Black Lives Matter, non-binary gender identity and so on. People have been able to find one another and quietly share the fact that they disagreed with the overarching consensus and build a coalition.

But you also get people locating people and saying: “Hey, you know, I’m not gonna openly call myself a racist when I’m running for office, but you and I, we’re both quite racist. And I just wanted you to know that.”

So you can build a coalition of racists who would otherwise struggle to finged one another because of the social risk that they take if they go public with their views, but it’s really not the same thing as mind control.

While I’ve been working on this essay, I’ve made myself watch the clip of “Kimmel Takes on Gawker Stalker” several times. It feels bad, and also bruise-pressingly bad-good once I’ve forced myself to press play. I get the same feeling by walking down Crosby Street in Soho, where the feel of cobblestones under my heels can still give me sense-memory flashbacks to the year I spent working in that storefront office, when I was young and everything that was happening, bad and good, was at least happening to me for the first time.

Every time I watch the clip I feel a little bit more distant from the person in it, who is both me and not exactly me. Reflexively, as old-me speaks, my brain reiterates the counterarguments I should have made, the ways I should have defended myself, even though it wouldn’t have mattered back then and definitely doesn’t matter now.

When it ends, I try to make myself stay in the moment, rather than rushing immediately to try to find the meaning. It might be that there is no sense to be made of this for me. There’s just the blunt, stupid feeling of humiliation, a strange and specific kind of loss. Who might I have become if this hadn’t been how I’d begun?

I was trying to see the human behind the industry, and speak directly to them in a way that would lower their defences and create space for authentic emotional engagement. What I didn’t realize, was that I had not put nearly enough thought into how to make space for their emotions beyond this disclaimer. It was like I believed this boilerplate would be good enough, and then I threw them to the wolves. 

So at the end of my talk, when it came time for Q and A, that’s when my skin started to crawl. The zoom room of approximately 50 people fell silent. Not a word. Not a question. I tread water for minutes, trying to lure them to share even the slightest reflection on what they’d heard me say. After what felt to me like an unbearable amount of time to stir in that awkwardness, one man said “I think it is very emotional for us to be reminded of the terrible things that we do.” OK, now we’re getting somewhere, I thought. I tried to respond in a compassionate way that would further the conversation, but failed. After a few more awkward attempts at stoking the dialog, another man said “I think I am of the generation where I will die of old age and not climate change, but that doesn’t bode well for my children.” Hoo boy. OK. True! Well spotted sir. I tried to respond but by that point, the negative affect coursing through my body was shutting down my ability to perform my best. I don’t even remember what I said, all I know is that twenty seconds later, the host adjourned the annual meeting, and we all logged off on a terribly tense note. 

Later on I received a couple of emails in which attendees said the talk was very emotional for them, and they were simply lost for words. As one CEO wrote “my feelings around the subject as a whole: Armageddon kind of feeling.”

The decline of going out is a pre-existing trend, but one that the pandemic will accelerate. Plenty of dressing gown-loving homebodies have already settled into this nicely. As the public sphere is eroded even further in the next few years, many of them will react with chortling indifference, so long as they can still order takeaways and watch content on the multiple entertainment platforms to which they subscribe.

This dressing-gown capitalism has done well out of Covid, with both streaming and takeaway apps enjoying a surge in usage, helped by the fact that staying in has come to be seen as morally virtuous. The responsibility for what happens after the pandemic lies with the government rather than consumer preferences, but it looks like people will continue to spend more time at home. There will be fewer places to go, fewer things to do and less communal space. At some point, checking our phones for the hundredth time while watching “UNTITLED DISNEY LIVE ACTION (2023)” on a laptop, we might start to regret this.

However much targeted advertising may have skewed the internet—prioritizing attention-grabbiness over quality, as Hwang suggests—that doesn’t mean we ought to let the system collapse on its own. We might hope instead for what Hwang calls a “controlled demolition” of the business model, in which it unravels gradually enough for us to manage the consequences.

How might that work? Hwang proposes a publicity campaign by researchers, activists, and whistleblowers that exposes the sickness of the online ad market, followed by regulations to enforce transparency. Digital advertisers would have to make public, standardized statements to help buyers evaluate their wares. The goal would be to narrow the dangerous disconnect between perceived and actual value.

These dense plays are concerned with a transition from a world of mystery to a world of history, from war to peace, from myth to reality, from aristocratic households to the democratic society of contemporary Athens. They describe the triumph of law over personal vendettas and revenge, and show the direct violence of the axe and the sword giving way to the buried structural violence of law and social institutions. They provide an implicit justification and celebration of recent Athenian history and the current political regime: in real life, the political and legal structures of democracy had replaced the old system of rule by tyrants, and there were still powerful aristocratic men in Athens who favoured oligarchy over democracy.

But most fundamentally, the trilogy uses all these interwoven narratives to tell a story that justifies the triumph of men over women. The institution of the all-male democratic law court, presided over by its male-biased judge, is presented as the only possible solution to the endless violence of the earlier world, one in which the experiences and voices of angry, wronged, grieving women were allowed to matter as much as those of men. The first two plays show the terrible cost, to both men and women, of a society in which men favour their bonds with one another over those with their mothers, wives and children. When Agamemnon kills his daughter, his men ‘tie a fetter round her/lovely cheeks and face,/a gag to hold her tongue from words to put her/house beneath a curse’. The final play reframes the problem of female suffering by including no human female characters: the powerful Furies are far more menacing than pitiable, and their semi-violent subordination by Athena, who threatens them with her father’s thunderbolt, is presented as the only possible way for the play’s vulnerable male human, Orestes, to be saved.

(…) In a time when we’re thinking about the voices marginalised in modern democracies, and about whose histories we want to tell, it is worth turning back, with curious and critical eyes, to Aeschylus’ great dramatic meditation on the politics of exclusion. Perhaps, after this huge gap of time, we can begin to hear what the gagged, murdered Iphigenia might have wanted to say.

In 1959, I was asked to join the GDR’s Construction Academy under Hermann Henselmann. Here, I focused on the potential of serial housing construction. We developed the prefab building type P2 to supply many people with high-quality living space in a short amount of time. This prototype later served as the template and starting point for countless of variations. I also invented the useful hatch between kitchen and living-room. Altogether, around 360,000 units of this type were realized. Based on this experience, we developed another residential construction series, the Wohnbauserie 70, that later dotted East Germany with 650,000 units. And while we considered it our duty and task to find new solutions for mass housing construction – we never envisaged the sheer number of units that would be built.

I like to draw parallels between my design practice and my professional career, from furniture designer to architect and city planner. All of my planning follows an inside-out route, strictly geared towards practical value – unlike many statement structures erected around the globe today. Design features should never come at the expense of energy efficiency, for example. From interior design to large-scale planning –residential construction and urban planning should always go hand in hand!

Rita Hasenkopf erkundet schon jahrelang, was in jeder Pflanze steckt. Ihre Schwiegermutter habe ihr anfangs einiges gezeigt, das, was ohne große Kochkunst essbar ist, das, was schnell hilft. Zerriebene Spitzwegerichblätter gegen Mückenstiche, Melisse zum Einschlafen – das Unmittelbare eben.

Das Mittelbare aber, das, wo man Fantasie entwickeln muss, um zu verstehen, wo man rumexperimentieren muss, das hat Hasenkopf sich über all die Jahre angeeignet. Einmal im Monat trifft sie sich mit anderen kräuterkundigen Frauen aus dem Schwarzwald. Sie tauschen sich aus, lernen voneinander, experimentieren mit Pasten, Salben, Likören und Essenzen, wohl wissend, dass sie der Pharmaindustrie ein Dorn im Auge sind. „Früher wurden die Hexen verbrannt, heute wird unser Wissen durch Vorschriften klein gehalten.“

In the year 2000, all I wanted, as a Black girl Radiohead fan, was to live with them out at these extremities. The woozy keyboard swirl and processed vocal gibberish of Everything in Its Right Place, the album’s opening track, announced the very opposite: all was about to be thrown thrillingly out of whack. The sublime Treefingers is a glimmering object that spins slowly around the universe; the spectacular plaintive sorrow of Motion Picture Soundtrack was an invitation to dive into a cinematic dreamscape of heartbreak. Why not live in these worlds, I thought, with the disaster of the US presidential election recount unfolding deep into the fall?

What makes Radiohead’s music such a radical endeavour to me are these deeply introspective other worlds, built as bulwarks against the tyrannies of everyday life (a world where “we’ve got heads on sticks / you’ve got ventriloquists,” as Thom Yorke sings in nightmarishly garbled vocals on the title track). Kid A’s recurring lyrical insistence on “slipping away” is nothing new to rock masculinity, an anxious nod to the stubborn will to “not fade” dating back to the genre’s earliest days. But it is also a gorgeous, revolutionary invitation to exist in an elsewhere, in a way that resonates with what scholars often refer to as the Black Radical tradition in music.

Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity – and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote misattributed to Gandhi, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.

How many combinations of unintended consequences and human reactions to them does it take to detour us into a future that seems to defy any obvious trend? Not many. That’s why predicting the future accurately is so difficult. Some of the most mistaken predictions I’ve seen are of the straight-line variety–that’s the kind that ignores the inevitability of unintended consequences, ignores our often less-than-logical reactions to them, and says simply, “In the future, we will have more and more of whatever’s holding our attention right now.” If we’re in a period of prosperity, then in the future, prosperity it will be. If we’re in a period of recession, we’re doomed to even greater distress. Of course, predicting an impossible state of permanent prosperity may well be an act of fear and superstitious hope rather than an act of unimaginative, straight-line thinking. And predicting doom in difficult times may have more to do with the sorrow and depression of the moment than with any real insight into future possibilities. Superstition, depression and fear play major roles in our efforts at prediction.

(…) So why try to predict the future at all if it’s so difficult, so nearly impossible? Because making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting in dangerous directions. Because prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer, wiser courses. Because, most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our today. Through thought and deed, we exert a great deal of influence over this child, even though we can’t control it absolutely. Best to think about it, though. Best to try to shape it into something good. Best to do that for any child.

The problem with all forms of expertise in public policy is that it is often the most formidable salespeople who claim greater certainty than the evidence allows who are invited to jet around the world advising governments. But the irony for behavioural scientists is that this is a product of them trading off, and falling prey to, the very biases they have made their names calling out.

I can only imagine how easy it might have been for Johnson to succumb to confirmation bias in looking for reasons to delay a lockdown: what prime minister wants to shut down the economy? And it is the optimism bias of the behavioural tsars that has led them to place too much stock in their own judgment in a world of limited evidence. But this isn’t some experiment in a university psychology department - it is a pandemic and lives are at stake.

“Pero no es que el sistema esté roto es que funciona así”, nos recuerda Carlos Fernández Liria: “El capitalismo no genera ocio, sino paro, que no es lo mismo. Paro y trabajo excesivo; pero de repartir nada, porque económicamente es imposible, la economía se pondría enferma con ese reparto”, así que entre la economía y nosotros, el sistema prefiere que enfermemos nosotros.

Esto lo corrobora la OMS cuando nos recuerda que cada año se suicidan unas 800 000 personas en el mundo y que la pobreza, el desempleo y las condiciones precarias de trabajo son sus principales responsables. Sorprende entonces, que la misma organización sugiera como soluciones parchecitos baratos como el ejercicio físico, los programas de prevención en las escuelas, la terapia y la medicación. La investigadora Noelle Sulivan pregunta, muy pertinentemente, si la pobreza y el paro son las principales causas de depresión, “¿No deberían nuestros remedios abordar los motores económicos de la pobreza y el desempleo en lugar de centrarse específicamente en programas escolares y ejercicio?” Y yo añadiría ¿en qué momento vamos a abordar los verdaderos factores que condicionan los problemas de salud mental?

VIII. O que é o socialismo? Para muitos marxistas é a transformação das relações de produção – através da apropriação coletiva dos meios de produção – para permitir o livre desenvolvimento das forças produtivas. O ecossocialismo se reivindica de Marx, mas rompe explicitamente com este modelo produtivista. É claro que a apropriação coletiva é indispensável, mas as próprias forças produtivas também devem ser radicalmente transformadas: a) mudando suas fontes de energia (renováveis ao invés de combustíveis fósseis); b) reduzindo o consumo global de energia; c) reduzindo (“decrescimento”) a produção de bens e eliminando atividades desnecessárias (publicidade) e pragas (pesticidas, armas de guerra); d) pondo um fim à obsolescência programada. O ecossocialismo também implica a transformação dos padrões de consumo, das formas de transporte, do planejamento urbano, do modo de vida. Em suma, é muito mais do que uma mudança nas formas de propriedade: é uma mudança civilizacional, baseada em valores de solidariedade, igualdade-liberdade (egaliberté) e respeito pela natureza. A civilização ecossocialista rompe com o produtivismo e o consumismo para favorecer a redução do tempo de trabalho e, portanto, a extensão do tempo livre dedicado a atividades sociais, políticas, lúdicas, artísticas, eróticas, etc., etc. Marx chamou este objetivo de o “Reino da Liberdade”.

(…) XIII. Temos chance de ganhar esta batalha antes que seja tarde demais? Ao contrário dos pretensos “colapssólogos”, que proclamam em alto e bom som que a catástrofe é inevitável e que qualquer resistência é inútil, nós acreditamos que o futuro permanece aberto. Não há garantia de que este futuro seja ecossocialista: é objeto de uma aposta no sentido de Pascal, na qual se engaja todas as forças em “trabalhar para a incerteza”. Mas, como disse Bertolt Brecht, com grande e simples sabedoria: “Aquele que luta pode perder. Aquele que não luta já perdeu”.

Compared to carrying coal by rail, moving oil by sea eliminated the labour of coal heavers and stokers, and thus the power of organised workers to withdraw their labour from a critical point in the energy system. Transoceanic shipping operated beyond the territorial spaces governed by the labour regulations and other democratic rights won in the era of widespread coal and railway strikes. In fact shipping companies could escape the regulation of labour laws altogether - as well as the payment of taxes - by registering their vessels in Panama or under other ‘flags of convenience’, removing whatever limited powers of labour organising might have remained.

(…) The *Torrey Canyon*, an oil tanker owned by a Bermuda-based subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California, registered in Liberia, chartered to BP, built in 1959 and rebuilt in 1966 in a Japanese shipyard to increase her size from 66,000 to 119,000 deadweight tons, ran aground off the coast of Cornwall, England, in March 1967. The tanker had set sail without knowing her final destination, and lacked detailed navigation charts for the coast of south-west England. The damage to the coastline and to wildlife was exacerbated by the lack of methods to handle large oil spills. The British government tried to set fire to the oil by having air defence forces bomb it with napalm, creating further damage and inadvertently revealing both their possession of the controversial weapon and the inaccuracy of the bombers (more than a quarter of the bombs missed their target).

It can be difficult to work out quite what exactly it is about the past that so many in Morrissey’s generation long for. It certainly isn’t council housing, full employment, free education, public ownership or social mobility, because if these are noted at all, it’s in the context of decrying the Labour Party’s foolish utopianism in trying to resurrect them.

What it is, is a nostalgia for misery, a longing for boredom, a relocation of poverty from economics to aesthetics. The belligerent ghouls. The spineless bastards. The beatings. The ignorance. The pollution and the soot. The gay-bashing and the paki-bashing. The murders on the Moors. The young are not only resented for not having suffered these, the obsessive recall of them is a way of constantly re-living an experience of personal struggle and uprooting, an origin story for home ownership and bored affluence, whether that’s the pettier example of the paid-off mortgage or the purchased council house, or in Morrissey’s case, the villa in the hills of LA. And who stands in the way of this self-aggrandisement through re-enactment? The Asians, especially the Muslims. The young. The left. The “woke”. And here, Morrissey is truly the voice of a generation.

Taken together, one message is clear: “The coronavirus is NOT the great equalizer.” With this in mind, many people are calling for more data on the disproportionate rates of infection and death among poor and racialized groups. And while I tend to support more data collection, I want to offer a caution. The facts alone will not save us.

According to a recent study on criminal justice reform out of Stanford, researchers demonstrated that “Using statistics to inform the public about racial disparities can backfire. Worse yet, it can cause some people to be more supportive of the policies that create those inequalities.” In other words, two people can see the same headline, “Black People Make up 40 percent of Covid-19 deaths in Michigan,” and come to very different conclusions! In fact, that is exactly what is happening.

Exhibit B: The US Surgeon General singled out Blacks and Latinos to urge “no drinking or smoking” as a preventative measure during the pandemic, which plays into a long history of government officials invoking the supposedly bad behavior of  racialized groups as the reason for their hardship. We see it with the very different responses to Black and White drug use, one is a crime and the other is a public health emergency.

The “culture of poverty” script is a reliable alibi that lets the bad behavior of powerful institutions off the hook, and goes back to at least the Moynihan Report in which Black women, in particular, are blamed for the so-called disfunctions of Black families and communities.

RS: I think we have a political duty not to use it [social media] to vent, not to use it to write, and not to allow it to harness our personal relations, and we also have a duty to save as much of our free time as possible from being captured by capital. I don’t want to take a moralising tone, but it’s similar to the duty to take your life seriously. If you take your life seriously, and take an overview of it, it’s pretty hard to justify the things we allow ourselves to do all the time. It’s not like anyone’s pure, and I’m not in a position to offer anyone salvation, I’m just saying that if you can do something else with those 50,000 hours of your life, and can use it in a professional way…

The self-made man: the man for whom we have to pretend we do not feel, do not need, is, as Hopper describes him, ‘simultaneously entitled, dismissive, and hard to get.’

Emerson believed that emotional dependence is the birthplace of shame. There is shame in being an object of empathy, he thought. There is shame in capitulating to requests for help.

A man ought to be able to withstand any degree of pain without the need to be soothed.

Reading this, I realised that Emerson’s self-made male archetype had seeped into my own belief system. Ever since I can remember, I have been convinced that there is shame not only in watching another person capitulate to my requests for help, but that there is shame in making the request at all.
In my romantic life, I learned not to ask for help because I knew, without ever being told, that in all likelihood the men sitting opposite me would see this as weakness.

With social media addiction, there are many more variables than with drugs, so it is hard to know where to begin. The designers of the smartphone or tablet interface, for example, have made sure that it is pleasurable to engage with, hold, or even just to look at. The urge to reach, irritably, for the device during meals, conversations, parties and upon awakening, can partly be attributed to lust for the object and the soft, nacreous glow of the screen. Once we have navigated to the app, it is the platform designers who take control. For the duration of our visit, life is briefly streamlined, as with a video game, into a single visual flow, a set of soluble challenges, some dangled rewards and a game of chance. But the variety of possible experiences include voyeurism, approval and disapproval, gaming, news, nostalgia, socialising and regular social comparisons. If we are addicted, we might just be addicted to the activities that the platforms enable, from gambling to shopping to spying on “friends”.

The platforms don’t organise our experience according to a masterplan. As the sociologist Benjamin Bratton puts it, the mechanism is “strict and invariable”, but within that “autocracy of means”, the user is granted a relative “liberty of ends”. The protocols of the platform standardise and order the interactions of users. They use incentives and choke points to keep people committed to the machine. They manipulate ends for the benefit of their real clients – other firms. They bombard us with stimuli, learning from our responses, the better to teach us how to be the market demographic we have been identified as. But they do not force us to stay there, or tell us what to do with the hours spent on the platform. Even more so than in the case of drugs, then, the toxicity is something we as users bring to the game.

Standard London millennial stuff = Millennials. Ah. That word. That concept. I find the obsession with generational divide – and actually assigning each tribe a name like being born at the same time makes you a homogeneous mass – and the ensuing culture war really really tiresome and lazy. It is a middle-class obsession. Plenty of people out there, of every generation, are experiencing the same problems, usually heightened because they have less money, no social mobility, suffer from prejudice and, most tragically, lack the contact email address of an opinion columns editor. Breaking news: people of all ages are being absolutely screwed by society – screaming about avocados, mortgages, and numbers on a birth certificate isn’t helpful, it’s a distraction. Can you all even hear yourselves?

Agricultural expansion depended not upon the settling of America, but on continuous and fitful cycles of dispossession, settling, unsettling, and resettling. Nineteenth-century populations were highly mobile, and they often carved out ecologies and communities that were precarious, fragile, and intentionally temporary. Many farmers planted on a particular plot of land always with an eye on the exit: the fantasy of cheap, fertile land out West. Others went West, and when they found it, immediately fled back East in shock.

For the millions of slaves laboring in Southern agriculture, the notion of permanent settlement ran afoul of the stark realities implicit in the traffic of souls: Slavers sold their slaves to cover debts, to hedge declining labor productivity as slaves aged, to dispose of difficult or rebellious slaves, and for a thousand other reasons. The movements of individual slaves often demonstrated a complex pattern not of settlement and permanence, but of internal flow, migration, and transience that follows precisely the trajectory of cotton cultivation: southwest and downriver. For indigenous populations, the history of agricultural expansion was the history of repeated dispossession and forced resettlement on increasingly marginal lands.

3:AM: You’ve said recently of *London* that “It’s a joke about a man who thinks he’d be happier if London was more like Paris.”  
PK: In the 1990s, especially in the early years of the Labour government, there was a widespread view that London would be a much better place if it could become more like a European city. Richard Rogers, especially in the post-1997 context of the Urban Task Force, and the Architecture Foundation, co-founded by Ricky Burdett, who later became a kind of architectural fixer for the capital, were among the leaders of this tendency, and the peak of its influence was probably in 1999, when the RIBA awarded its Royal Gold Medal not to an architect, but to the city of Barcelona. When Pasqual Maragall came to accept the award, he made a speech in which he compared London under Thatcher to Spain under Franco. In the end, however, the Barcelonaisation of London seems to have consisted of a few landmark buildings, notably Tate Modern, the refurbishment of Trafalgar Square, the Jubilee Line extension, a lot of restaurants, and phenomena such as the gentrification of now-fashionable mid-20th century public-sector housing developments and the annual London Festival of Architecture. London has been equipped with the kind of culture that makes life tolerable for educated international bankers, but the revival of urbanism that Rogers and his milieu continue to argue for has not really progressed very far, other than in contexts such as the Olympic Games: ‘High Street 2012’, for example. Instead the city was thrown open to international finance, and has become notorious for its extraordinary economic inequality. It is surprising how many artists and other creative types formerly associated with London now live elsewhere, usually in places where space is cheaper, and everyday life much easier to enjoy.

Thoughts on Claire Denis’ High Life  
Self containment: the spaceship’s recycling and re-circulating all fluids/excretions. Piss/shit turned back into food via the garden. Sedative drugs extracted from piss and re-used.  
Incest: as the logical end-point of this self containment / self sufficiency. Monstrous vision of the dogs on the other spaceship happily breeding away. Desire for containment set against the taboo of incest (like *24 Shots of Rum*).

Today, the [Irish] landscape is greener than it has ever been. Much of the country is an expanse of bright fields of monoculture rye grass which is grazed by millions of cows. There is nothing natural about this vivid shade of green. It is, quite literally, artificial – the result of the application of chemical nitrogen fertiliser. Far from being an indicator of intrinsic fertility, the green of Ireland’s fields today is distinctly unnatural.

If today’s glossy green is the result of man-made chemicals, does the Irish landscape have a ‘natural’ colour palette? Can we imagine the land before humans exerted such a strong influence on its form and appearance?

Compilation literature—I’m using a term invented by the Byzantinist Catherine Holmes here—is produced by copying, summarizing, reordering, updating, and excerpting pre-existing material, and shaping these materials to fit the author-compiler’s current situation or eventual goal. Byzantine compilation literature spans genres: military handbooks, agriculture, hagiography, medicine, law, moralizing literature, and dream interpretation are all locations where we can see Byzantine authors employing these methods. The sheer predominance of compilation literature suggests that it was highly efficacious for Byzantine persons—that producing texts in this way was productive, solved problems, was useful and effective.

“Well never see bison roaming the entire Great Plains again,” said Proctor. “We’ll never see 20 million to 30 million bison again. No one is trying to go back in time. We’re trying to go forward. We’re trying to restore this important animal where we can, where people want them, and to the level where they will help restore the natural balance.”
For any of this to happen, Native American tribes will be key. They have the land and the desire to bring back the continent’s largest land mammal. And it’s not just bison, Proctor said. They have been instrumental in conserving wolves, grizzly bears, swift foxes and black-footed ferrets among other species.

«D’une manière générale, faire pipi et caca dans l’eau n’est pas une bonne idée. Toute la richesse du produit se retrouve complètement diluée au départ et cela pose problème pour la récupérer après», précise Bruno Tassin, directeur de thèse de Fabien Esculier et membre d’OCAPI. Sans compter l’énergie et les frais pour traiter les eaux usées en aval. C’est pourquoi le programme de recherche planche sur une séparation des excréments à la source. Urine d’un côté, matière fécale de l’autre. Façon aussi de limiter les contaminations.

«L’urine est très peu facteur de maladies alors qu’au contraire les matières fécales sont le support de la transmission du choléra, de la gastro-entérite etc. Les seuls systèmes à la fois circulaires et salubres sont ceux qui séparent urine et matière fécale», détaille Fabien Esculier. Pour abattre résidus médicamenteux ou germes de l’urine, une solution consiste à faire reposer le liquide. Lors du stockage, le pH élevé et l’ammoniaque détruisent les molécules indésirables. C’est ce que recommande l’OMS, qui s’est penchée sur la façon dont utiliser sans risque les urines et matières fécales en agriculture.

Even Jimmy Emmons, who seems about as self-assured as a farmer can be, acknowledged that he doesn’t even go to his local coffee shop anymore. If he did, he’d hear disapproval from his fellow farmers for doing things like planting his wheat directly into a living stand of plant residue without tilling or grazing his animals on cover crops.
On one panel at the conference, for instance, Adam Chappell responded to a comment made about the science of monoculture by saying, “There is no scientific evidence of the benefit of monoculture, but there is plenty of propaganda. The salesmen tell me constantly that I’m stupid, or that I’ll go broke” because he’s using fewer inputs.

Tuning out those messages, he added, has become a lot easier thanks to the network of other no-till farmers he stays in touch with online—Twitter and YouTube are popular platforms for sharing photos, observations, and videos of one another’s farms—and at conferences like No-till in the Plains.

In other words, namaste, as it circulates today, within global news media, its stock images, and associated pop culture trends like yoga tourism, functions as a controlling image. And so, as my Uber driver clearly demonstrated to me, it is easily weaponized as a slur. In this light, the interdependence of white paternalism and popular culture in the U.S. explodes the notion that namaste, as it appears in our daily lives today, is somehow innocuous, much less inclusive.

Mais la vie y était moins chère et l’air y semblait meilleur qu’au centre de la ville, alors Maria Caccioppoli et son mari ont déménagé en 2003. Ce qu’ils ne savaient pas encore, c’est qu’ils venaient de s’installer au beau milieu d’une zone qui allait acquérir, plusieurs années après, une célébrité nationale, héritant au passage d’un surnom terrible : « Terra dei fuochi », littéralement « Terre des feux ». Une région maudite, constituée de 55 communes à cheval sur les provinces de Naples et de Caserte, transformée en décharge à ciel ouvert, où l’incurie des citoyens, la corruption des puissants et le crime organisé ont concouru à empoisonner le sol, au point de mettre gravement en péril la santé des habitants.

The word Barthes uses is *délicatesse* - a beautiful sequence of syllables to walk through the mouth. A decisive principle of the oeuvre, writes Tiphanie Samoyault, *délicatesse* is ‘the contrary of arrogance’ and another name for what Barthes called ‘the neutral’. But where the neutral is imagined as a utopia (in grammar, the neutral or neuter is neither masculine nor feminine, neither active nor passive; in politics, Barthes sees it as a refusal to take sides on complex conflictual questions phrased in such a way as to permit only yes/no answers), *délicatesse* is the name given to the small-scale, everyday practice of values such as goodwill and attentiveness, what Barthes also calls ‘sweetness’ (*la douceur*), values in the form of behaviours that parry the already decided, the apparent self-evidence, the all-purpose explanation - and attend to those small, fleeting and fragile moments in life where, as Samoyault puts it, ‘individuals truly express themselves in their truth’.

The salient point remains that after the Reformation much of late Tudor London was in a ruined condition, with walls and gateways and ancient stone windows to be glimpsed among the shops and houses which lined the lanes and thoroughfares. Even in the area outside the walls, where the palaces of the bishops and nobles had led down from the Strand towards the river, the grand houses were, according to the Venetian ambassador, ‘disfigured by the ruins of a multitude of churches and monasteries’.

I’m a wildlife biologist. Decades ago, I visited a team working to restore streamsides churned to bare gravel by placer mining. They were planting willow and alder in hopes of stabilizing the banks and preventing further erosion. Other vegetation could then move in and once again shade the passing waters, cooling them for native trout and spawning salmon. I was already picturing songbirds returning to nest in the lush foliage while mink, otters, and bears patrolled the shores, except the normally hardy willow and alder wouldn’t grow. They withered instead, and the banks stayed empty — until the team prepared the next batch to be planted by first soaking their roots in a broth containing certain fungi. This is common practice today. It wasn’t then. Besides changing the way I’ve planted trees at home ever since, the visit made me realize that my view of the most important wildlife in ecosystems might be upside-down.

(…) Ten to 20 percent of the sugars a plant produces through photosynthesis are absorbed by the mycorrhizae. In return, the fungus delivers many essential nutrients to the plant and increases drought resistance. Higher crop yields can be the result for gardeners. As the ends of the hyphae weave among soil particles via cracks and crannies too small for even the narrowest root hair, the mycelium becomes an auxiliary root system that’s in contact with a subterranean volume of soil from several hundred to 2,500 times greater than what the plant could reach alone.

(…) Although we think of fungi being most at home in deep, dank forests, they’re surprisingly abundant in open shrublands and prairies, too. The outer walls of hyphae contain gluey compounds that cause fine particles of earth to clump together on and around the threads. This process is a major factor in building soil structure and making the ground less vulnerable to erosion. Mycelial networks also play a valuable role in sequestering carbon within microclusters of filaments. They limit their partner plants’ exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, zinc and cadmium, by keeping those elements bound to the hyphae’s sticky sheath. At high latitudes and high altitudes, mycorrhizal fungi scrounge nutrients from cold, rocky soils. In boggy regions, the hyphae buffer plant partners from the high acid content of peaty soils. In saline ground, the hyphae help safeguard their partners from high salt concentrations. Mycorrhizae can also protect plants from pests and diseases.

The elite of Paris writers haven’t accepted Guène into their fold. She’s not alone in feeling that France’s stilted, hidebound literary scene badly needs “new blood”. But she thinks the literary establishment still believes the suburbs and poor people are “not noble or interesting enough to belong to literature or fiction”. It’s fine for people from the high-rises to play football, or rap but the idea of intellectuals existing there is still taboo. Oddly, considering her huge international success, she hasn’t won any prizes in France, just small informal awards voted by young people and readers. Does she think that will change? “The big prizes? Are you crazy? Never, never in my life will I get a prize. That would mean recognising that what I write is literature, that there are intellectuals in the banlieues. That’s where nothing’s changing and the neo-colonialist vision comes in to play … the idea that the ‘natives’ can do sport, sing and dance but not think.”

Most of her subjects, who often describe themselves as Afro-Russians, had grown up without much contact with other black people or with little of the shared culture and identity familiar to African-Americans and black Britons. “The amount we know about our African heritage varies from individual to individual,” says Johnson Artur. What they do have in common however, is a history of struggle against a commonly encountered resistance to the presence of black people in Russia. “Those who grew up and live in Russia still have to justify on a daily basis the fact that they are Russians too.” Johnson Artur hopes her project will go some to connecting and making visible the generation of black Russians that have grown up calling the country home.

It is apparent that the Arab cinema industry has no qualms about practising Arab-washing, following in the footsteps of Hollywood and its penchant for whitewashing stories and characters.

But while in the US the use of blackface has been largely phased out, in Arab cinema it is constantly used in order to have non-black Arabs cast in black roles. They often don blackface, put on exaggerated fake buttocks, thick Afro curly hair and bright-red lipstick.

It is also indicative that for decades the first and only dark-skinned actor who played leading roles in Egyptian cinema was Ahmed Zaki (1949- 2005). But even he did not escape racial characterisation: He was nicknamed the “Bronze Star” and the “Black Tiger”.

However, as the long process of compulsory purchase, eviction and demolition was under way, between 1890 and 1895, it became clear that no philanthropic company was willing to come forward. And so, very reluctantly, the home secretary permitted the LCC to construct the dwellings, on the understanding that these would quickly be sold on to the charitable sector. The LCC was not to act as a landlord. Antipathy towards state intervention in housing was put most colourfully in Parliament by the member for Portsmouth, who told the house that such a thing was “monstrous”, and that “if such a principle were admitted, I do not know where it will stop. The next demand made of Parliament might be to provide clothing, if not carriages and horses, for the poor”.

And it may surprise you to learn – given the obloquy that subsequently descended on these planners’ fancies – that they [aerial walkways] worked.  One resident recalls a trip to the local shops – along those walkways – taking hours to complete as she stopped to talk to everyone she met, and she knew nearly everyone.  The corridors were also a place to meet and socialise; doors left unlocked with children playing in one flat but regularly checked on by neighbours.

This was true, apparently, even of the now reviled tower blocks.  People met in lifts and on landings. Fiona, my guide to the estate, living then in Aragon Tower, remembers a close and friendly community – ‘you could knock on any door’ – and recalls too how scrupulously tenants maintained the common areas according to a rota issued by the estate caretaker.

(…) If you know the Pepys Estate or its sometime reputation, you’ll know there’s one other thing I haven’t mentioned – race.  The Estate was in its early years and for some time an almost exclusively white estate, this the result of a more or less formal policy operated by the GLC.  As one former council housing officer describes”

“It wasn’t as simple as ‘We don’t want black people living there’.  It was more like an assumption that black and white would rather live separately from one another.  So, as you go down the Old Kent Road you can see some estates are white and others are black or mixed. It didn’t happen by accident. Housing officers just didn’t allocate black people to [the Pepys Estate].”

But caution about the potential of our cities and suburbs as wildlife habitat is probably still a good idea. One danger is that these landscapes may become “ecological sinks” — that is, places where excess individuals from undisturbed habitat can survive, but not ultimately increase. Having straw-headed bulbuls in central Singapore does not, for instance, ensure survival of the species. Success with some more visible species may also blind us to broader but less obvious declines in other species. European rewilding, for instance, has not been rewilding for its insect population.

Small grains are “cool season” crops that are planted in the spring and provide coverage for the soil in the wet months, reducing erosion and soaking up excess nutrients that might otherwise end up in waterways. And since they’re harvested in July, farmers can then plant warm-season cover crops in the summer that develop robust root systems. This helps the soil function as a vital living ecosystem that retains more water, stores more carbon, and requires less fertilizer to grow food.

“It’s a matter of how we engage on the social front there.”

“It is a complex theme. We just need to be tapping into the objective of profile raising and how we can knit these objectives together over the next reporting season.”

“… so that we’re being much more aware of the brand when it comes to providing teams with our learnings.”

“We’ll get some great learnings in terms of the kinds of traction it gets, we just need to be on the front foot.”

“At the level that’s feasible for the team. Let’s go with what there is. Though there’s a little bit of work all three of us have been doing in terms of aligning and messaging with what’s already been put out.”

“If we see some traction there…”

“It’s a meeting I’m keen to push back on, and obviously we just need to be looping in with her.”

“Pushing the envelope of doing things differently. It’s an opportunity to be seized rather than waiting for it to happen.”

“The more we can join up, the more we can detail our own messaging.”

“How do we want to wrap it up, what’s our umbrella? Is it that the individual tactical elements just become pegged on the branding aspects of that journey?”

“There’s also the need to confirm what the story is with the project – we don’t want it slipping into Christmas.”

But in Fleet Road, Alexandra Road, etc I began to reject the notion of modernism as wiping out the past; I embraced a modernism which took on board the notion of a continuing culture and history.

(…) First you have to set up a basic national building authority, then draw up a national document on house building, working on the Parker Morris standards of the 1960s. Morris created “Homes for Today and Tomorrow”, which was an absolutely remarkable adventure into housing. It meant housing could be flexible, with a range of designs; it encouraged experiment. We need a new version of this. These building standards would be used by local authorities, who would build the houses.

Flat walls of yellow brick and simple grids of windows mean it can fill any plot of land and allow for endless repetition, while the general flimsiness can be hidden behind signifiers of permanence and solidity. Its easy negotiation of building codes and its suitability to historically sensitive areas has made it indispensable to developers, too, so it’s easy to see why this often shoddily built pastiche rubbish has become so endemic.

In Tucson, Arizona, for example, house finches have developed longer and wider beaks than their rural counterparts to more easily consume sunflower seeds in bird feeders. In Puerto Rican cities, lizards’ toes have evolved to grip and move more easily on artificial surfaces, like concrete or brick. Several studies have also shown that urban pollution can increase mutation rates of DNA in birds and mammals. A new species of mosquito appears to be emerging that survives underground in sewers and subways.

A cynical view of Crowdtap is that it’s just another form of social media marketing — people being paid to tell their friends to buy things. But then you realize that these people don’t have large social media followings (in fact, Crowdtap users I interviewed said they create throwaway social media accounts to use exclusively for Crowdtap). And sharing content on social media isn’t even required — the default option is to share, but you get your points either way. Crowdtap passes members’ responses on to brands, but otherwise nobody is listening to what they say. No one is responding. There’s very little about this that might be called social. Imagine someone wandering alone in a giant desert, shouting “I love Big Macs!” into the sky. That’s Crowdtap.

3 stars: Not compatible with older Macbook Pros  
The MagSafe connector on this power adaptor does not fit older models of MacBook Pro. This newer connector is marginally smaller and does not fit snugly into the socket on the computer. I bought two of these at the Apple Store, Regent Street which didn’t, and I was eventually advised to buy the older part number NA938B for my January 2008 MBP. Check before you buy!

But the part of the movement that is willing to go all the way is still very small. The most popular figure in U.S. politics right now is Bernie Sanders—a Jewish socialist—while Trump’s popularity is at an all-time low. A purely oppositional politics to the far right will be a game of eternal whack-a-mole if the only vision of the future to be found in the aimless desert of meaning created by the political establishment is the nightmarish Silicon Valley model of modernity. The creation of a politics that offers something meaningful, beautiful, hopeful, new, and utopian is the project for which there is no shortcut. To take the bigger picture from this sorry story, it should be the job of our generation to create it.

Another critic of the crackdown is Dr. Ugo Rossi, a geographer at the University of Turin and author of the book Cities in Global Capitalism. He points out that the law is a response to fundamental changes to the underlying character of Italian city centers. “It’s a structural problem” Rossi says, “one that is particularly evident in Rome and other tourist-dominated cities.” Thanks to the deregulation of the housing market and the rise of home-sharing services like Airbnb, the hearts of many historic Italian towns have become increasingly oriented towards tourist accommodation and businesses, “emptying” them of local residents. “What increasingly replaces them are tourists—or in cities such as Bologna, students—who are not respectful of public space,” says Rossi. “As a result city centers are now just places of consumption rather than residency—ones that are no longer used by local people.”

Not all cities suffer equally from residential displacement, however. “The city centers that have survived this kind of transformation are those in southern Italy’s major cities, such as Naples, Palermo, Bari” says Rossi, “where despite some touristification many people are still living in the city core. So reflexes like [the Daspo Urbano] are on the one hand related to anxieties about security, and on the other about fears of a loss of authenticity, or local people who are more protective of their environment.”

Baker had opportunities in France that a black woman did not have in segregated US society and she did not have to deal with the daily outrage of a color line. At the same time the French and European obsession with Baker’s ‘primitivism’, which she played into with her famous banana dance, spoke to a racism magnetized by the erotic possibilities of blacks. In the twilight of European colonialism she symbolized the elusive native, the one who sang, danced, and tantalized but remained independent. Emerging half-naked on stage from a giant cage, Baker capitalized on barely-repressed European racial fantasies and turned them into a personal fortune. As she said, “Leers and dirty looks are two sides of the same coin.”

The African American world paid close attention to Baker and the Revue Négre as they conquered Paris. W.E.B Du Bois took note of her in The Crisis and the African American press chronicled her successes. Middle-class white Americans, few of whom had ever seen Baker perform during her US career, knew of Baker but paid her little more than brief attention. It was in Europe where Baker had the most profound impact as the American image of the Jazz Age. Two Americans especially mattered to Europeans in the 1920s: Woodrow Wilson and Josephine Baker.

The [Department of Energy] has a program, for example, to provide low-interest loans to companies to encourage risky corporate innovation in alternative energy and energy efficiency. The loan program became infamous when one of its borrowers, the solar-energy company Solyndra, was unable to repay its loan, but, as a whole, since its inception in 2009, the program has turned a profit. And it has been demonstrably effective: it lent money to Tesla to build its factory in Fremont, California, when the private sector would not, for instance. Every Tesla you see on the road came from a facility financed by the D.O.E. Its loans to early-stage solar-energy companies launched the industry. There are now 35 viable utility-scale, privately funded solar companies—up from zero a decade ago. And yet today the program sits frozen. “There’s no direction what to do with the applications,” says the young career civil servant. “Are we shutting the program down?” They’d rather not, but if that’s what they are going to do, they should do it. “There’s no staff, just me,” says the civil servant. “People keep bugging me for direction. It’s got to the point I don’t care if you tell me to tear the program down. Just tell me what you want to do so I can do it intelligently.” Another permanent employee, in another wing of the D.O.E., says, “The biggest change is the grinding to a halt of any proactive work. There’s very little work happening. There’s a lot of confusion about what our mission was going to be. For a majority of the workforce it’s been demoralizing.”

Altogether, it takes seven years for the wildebeest bones to fully disintegrate, releasing nutrients like phosphorous and carbon into the river. This slow decomposition, while unpleasant to smell, is crucial for the Mara River ecosystem, sustaining microbes, insects, and fish, as well as large scavengers. In the past, river ecologists had assumed that high levels of dissolved carbon from rotting corpses are unhealthy and unnatural for rivers. But the researchers found  that protected parks actually have more dissolved carbon their rivers compared to unprotected ones, suggesting that less human influence can sometimes mean more putrid rivers.

(…) Unfortunately, there are few ecosystems that can directly compare to the Mara. That’s because humans have disrupted nearly every large herbivore migration on the planet, and continue to kill off these key animals faster than they can kill themselves. It’s practically impossible for human biologists to get an accurate sense of what ecosystems looked like before the loss of large animals, because, according to many paleoecologists, humans have been wiping out large animals since the prehistoric migrations out of Africa.

The human migration across the Bering Strait into the Americas 15,000 years ago was followed by the extinctions of American mammoths and mastodons, giant ground sloths, sabre-tooth cats and giant armadillos. Other continents also suffered losses. When humans first landed in Australia 60,000 years ago, they would have encountered 500-pound kangaroos, 10-foot-tall flightless birds, wombat relatives the size of rhinoceroses, and monitor lizards that grew to over 20 feet long. By 45,000 years ago, all of those species were gone.

Most of her videos are too unnerving to watch from beginning to end for reasons that are hard to put your finger on.

Making matters worse is the astonishing “safety” record of the chemical industry. Between January and August 2016, China suffered 232 accidents in chemical factories, such as leaks, fires and explosions—almost one a day. Since around a fifth of these factories are in China’s most productive agricultural areas or near rivers used for irrigation, many of the spilled chemicals end up in fields. Chemical factories are not the only culprits. About 150km from Mr Tang’s village, in a town called Chenzhou, part of a lead and zinc mine collapsed in 1985, flooding nearby farms with arsenic, a by-product of mining. Arsenic concentrations in the soil were 24 times the legal limit 30 years later.

The second big problem is that land is being poisoned by “sewage irrigation”. Wastewater and industrial effluent are used in increasing amounts for irrigation because there is not enough fresh water to go round. In the north of China there is less water available per person than in Saudi Arabia, so farmers use whatever they can get. China produces over 60bn tonnes of sewage a year and in rural areas only 10% of it is treated. Most of the sludge goes into lakes and rivers, and thence onto fields.

A study in 2014 found that 39 out of 55 areas using sewage irrigation were contaminated by cadmium, arsenic and other poisons and that the accumulation of heavy metals in intensively irrigated areas was rising. An earlier study from 2010 found that water along 18% of the length of China’s rivers was too polluted for use in agriculture. It is used anyway.

One of the most influential art historians of the era was Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He produced two volumes recounting the history of ancient art, Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (1764), which were widely read and came to form a foundation for the modern field of art history. These books celebrate the whiteness of classical statuary and cast the Apollo of the Belvedere — a Roman marble copy of a Hellenistic bronze original — as the quintessence of beauty. Historian Nell Irvin Painter writes in her book The History of White People (2010) that Winckelmann was a Eurocentrist who depreciated people of other nationalities, like the Chinese or the Kalmyk.

“Color in sculpture came to mean barbarism, for they assumed that the lofty ancient Greeks were too sophisticated to color their art,” Painter writes. The ties between barbarism and color, civility and whiteness would endure. Not to mention Winckelmann’s pronounced preference for sculptures of gleaming white men over women. Regardless of his own sexual identity — which may have been expressed in this preference — Winckelmann’s gender bias would go on to have an impact on white male supremacists who saw themselves as upholding an ideal.

Comment faire pour «ouvrir le corps» tout en chassant l’image répugnante du cadavre ? Dominique Brancher raconte : à l’idée négative de la dissection, l’image anatomique substitue celle, érotique, d’un dévoilement. Il s’agit de jouer sur l’attrait du mystère et de l’interdit. La gynécologie devient donc, en toute bonne logique, le premier bastion à faire sauter : ce savoir, jusqu’ici réservé aux sage-femmes, fait l’objet d’une florissante production sur le marché éditorial français du XVIe siècle. «En 1482 paraît à Lyon la première gravure sur bois représentant une dissection académique». Comme par hasard, «c’est le corps d’une femme éventrée que cernent cinq médecins aux poses hiératiques. Au cours des mêmes années lyonnaises sont publiées les premières gravures de dissections “profanes”, qui accompagnent les éditions du Roman de la Rose : Néron, devant sa mère assassinée, ordonne l’ouverture de l’utérus pour percer le mystère de son origine. 

(…) Près de soixante ans plus tard, dans un style flamboyant et plus sensuel, Vésale fera le même choix audacieux : sur le frontispice ouvrant le De humani corporis fabrica (Bâle, Oporinus, 1543), une foule agitée entoure un cadavre féminin découpé.»

Les premières images anatomiques sont donc, principalement, des images indécentes de corps féminin qu’une foule de mâles sondent, pénètrent, théorisent, commentent et s’approprient avec une sorte de délectation que le lecteur est invité à partager. «Le genre des “secrets des femmes” constitue une invention proprement européenne, souligne Dominique Brancher. Cette invention prétend distiller, sur le ton de la confidence, un savoir ésotérique et fonde son efficacité culturelle sur le jeu dialectique de l’exhibition et de la dissimulation, ce qu’on pourrait appeler le “spectacle du secret”. Paradoxalement, pour exister, le secret doit se signaler à ceux qu’il vise et montrer qu’il cache». Montrer qu’il cache : c’est le ressort même de la pornographie qui met l’orgasme féminin en scène, spectaculairement, comme une sorte d’événement dont on ne peut jamais être tout à fait sûr de l’avoir vu. L’orgasme féminin relève de l’invisible. On peut le simuler. Dès lors, en faire des films, c’est comme se condamner à tuer sa mère dans l’espoir de comprendre pourquoi elle vous a mis au monde.

Pour Jean-Laurent Cassely, cette véritable «anomalie sociologique» trouve son origine dans «l’appauvrissement des tâches des métiers à dominante intellectuelle». Se basant sur de nombreux témoignages recueillis auprès de ces «néo-artisans», le journaliste constate ainsi un décalage croissant entre les attentes de ces jeunes ex-cadres et la réalité du travail qui leur était demandé dans leurs anciens jobs. Un décalage souvent brandi comme le motif principal de leur reconversion. «Beaucoup se voyaient comme avant-garde de la mondialisation, et non comme de bons petits soldats de la suite Microsoft office», résume ainsi le journaliste.

(…) La thèse, pour séduisante qu’elle soit, a cependant ses limites. Comme le note avec humour Jean-Laurent Cassely, on aurait tort de voir dans ces «néo-artisans» de farouches alter-mondialistes résolus à renverser le dogme existant. Bien au contraire. Comme il le démontre brillamment, leurs projets de reconversion s’intègrent parfaitement à l’économie de marché. «Par leur capacité à aborder différents secteurs de l’artisanat sous l’angle abstrait de leur ancienne formation, ils reclassent des secteurs autrefois dévalorisés», nous explique-t-il. S’ils redessinent notre conception de l’organisation du travail, ces «néo-artisans» entretiennent également la logique de gentrification des centres urbains, répondant à la demande d’une clientèle dont ils maîtrisent parfaitement les codes, puisqu’ils en sont issus et qu’ils les côtoient dans les hypercentres urbains désormais réservés aux catégories aisées de la population française.

The effect of Dodge’s realm – the LA art world – on her work has been profound. “I tend to think of writing almost structurally – I’m a kind of formalist – and my ideas about how to solve problems don’t always come from other books.” It was a culture shock, moving to LA from New York, as she did many years ago now. But it was also freeing. “There’s no pedestrian culture here. You’re never going to walk into a bookstore and see what everyone is reading, and therefore you can drift. That can be bad, but it’s also good: you don’t respond to trends, you follow strange leads.”

Writing has always been something I do feverishly, along with trying to make ends meet. But I also know that if you spend too much time thinking about a simulacrum of yourself, it takes you away from the act of writing. You need to shut everything out. I think of ideas as murmuring things you have to let talk to you in a quiet room, and that requires a lot of concentration as I get older.”

Perhaps, in the end, everything will continue just as it was before. “The world is full of distractions,” she says, softly. “And I have to listen more and more closely.”

La première raison du succès politique de la notion de ville compacte, définie comme « villes des petites distances » (entre domicile, lieux d’emploi, commerces, hôpitaux, etc.), est qu’elle apparaît comme un instrument efficace pour réduire les effets négatifs de la décroissance urbaine sur la vie quotidienne des Japonais. À l’instar de ce qui est observé dans les villes en décroissance européennes (Baron et al. 2010), le déclin progresse en perforant les tissus urbains japonais : des commerces ferment, faute d’usagers, ce qui allonge les distances à parcourir pour trouver des magasins ouverts (Iwama 2011) ; une maison vacante non entretenue se détériore et nuit à la qualité de l’environnement résidentiel, etc.

Dans la recherche et les médias, l’agriculture urbaine est considérée comme une pratique universellement bénéfique, incapable de générer le moindre désagrément. Pourtant, de plus en plus de chercheur·e·s, souvent issu·e·s de la géographie radicale et critique (Guthman 2008 ; Safransky 2014 ; Tornaghi 2014), ont pris le contre-pied de cette posture, en rappelant que les bénéfices annoncés sont plus controversés qu’au premier abord et sont souvent insuffisamment étayés. Les avantages économiques réels, les services écosystémiques rendus, et les créations d’emplois liés à l’agriculture urbaine demeurent difficiles à évaluer et minimes à ce jour. Il y a peu de preuves de lien direct entre l’occupation des parcelles vacantes par l’agriculture urbaine et la baisse du taux de criminalité (Raleigh et Galster 2014).

En réalité, les bénéfices sont envisagés pour des habitants qui ont des niveaux d’engagement très hétérogènes, notamment en termes d’acceptation et d’intérêt pour l’agriculture urbaine. Les habitants de Détroit consultés dans le cadre du processus de légalisation ont exprimé un scepticisme généralisé (Paddeu 2017). Ils considèrent l’agriculture urbaine comme une source d’incertitudes et de nuisances (pesticides, cultures OGM, élevage…). Ainsi, plutôt que de constituer un facteur attractif à même de revivifier les quartiers vidés de leurs habitants, elle pourrait en fait constituer un facteur répulsif et contribuer à leur départ. Une étude menée dans un quartier de Détroit montre que les résidents ont une foi limitée dans le pouvoir de l’agriculture urbaine d’améliorer leur vie quotidienne ainsi que de changer la dynamique sociale du quartier (Draus et al., 2014). De fait, l’écart reste substantiel entre les aspirations idéalistes des habitants-militants, constituant un réseau très actif mais restreint, et l’implication de la majorité des résidents.

Je commençais à connaître l’exacte valeur du langage parlé ou muet de l’amabilité aristocratique, amabilité heureuse de verser un baume sur le sentiment d’infériorité de ceux à l’égard desquels elle s’exerce mais pas pourtant jusqu’au point de la dissiper, car dans ce cas elle n’aurait plus de raison d’être. “Mais vous êtes notre égal, sinon mieux”, semblaient, par toutes leurs actions, dire les Guermantes ; et ils le disaient de la façon la plus gentille que l’on puisse imaginer, pour être aimés, admirés, mais non pour être crus ; qu’on démêlât le caractère fictif de cette amabilité, c’est ce qu’ils appelaient être bien élevés ; croire l’amabilité réelle, c’était la mauvaise éducation.

The desire to censor the pregnant female body is nothing new, and it goes hand in hand with our inability to discuss things like the menstrual cycle without deferring to the delicate sensibilities of actual or imagined listeners, particularly male ones. Beyoncé’s photographs were accompanied by a poem by Warsan Shire, making the link to Venus— goddess of love— explicit, and reinforcing the sexual aspect of the images: ‘in the dream I am crowning / osun, / Nerfetiti, / and yemoja / pray around my bed’. The photograph that seemed to incense people the most was the one posed sitting on the roof of a car: a hyper-sexualised pose familiar to many from calendars and glamour magazines.

Critics were also vocal about the ‘exploitative’ nature of the photographs, suggesting that there was something unseemly about Beyoncé— who, as of March 2017, has a net worth estimated by Forbes to be over $290 million — ‘using’ her pregnancy to contribute to her lucrative personal brand. The announcement illustrated a familiar truth: the intersection of female sexuality and economic power— and its mirror image, commodification— touches on deep-seated societal fears. Although the smattering of tight-lipped comment pieces framing their disapproval of the photograph’s lavish celebration of the pregnant body as concern for childless women were mostly disingenuous— this concern doesn’t usually seem to bother tabloid newspapers who mine ‘fertility’ dramas for exposure— they served to illuminate the paradox of maternity: censorship goes hand in hand with idealisation. Some of the positive responses to the announcement were deceptively conservative in their valourisation of motherhood as a woman’s ‘true’ purpose, something all too easily appropriated by exclusionary and harmful discussions about what ‘real’ womanhood is or should be.

« Sous Khrouchtchev, la stratégie reposait sur la création de microquartiers au centre desquels se trouvaient une école, une polyclinique, où les voitures ne circulaient pas. La distance entre chaque immeuble et l’école ne devait pas dépasser 400 mètres », poursuit Evgueni Asse en traçant des croquis sur sa longue table de travail. Pour la première fois, surtout, les ­Soviétiques accèdent au logement individuel. En 1950, plus de la moitié des cinq millions d’habitants dans la capitale russe vivaient encore dans des kommunalka, des appartements communautaires, ou dans des baraques en bois, construites après-guerre à titre temporaire.

« L’accès aux khrouchtchevki, c’était l’accession non à la propriété privée, mais aux appartements séparés, à la possibilité de s’installer en famille, souligne la Française Hélène Richard, auteure d’une thèse sur le logement et la propriété en Russie. Les immeubles étaient gérés par des entreprises d’Etat ou des municipalités qui établissaient des baux et se chargeaient de l’entretien et des documents. Les charges étaient très faibles. » Transmis aux enfants, ces baux soviétiques, plutôt protecteurs, ont concerné des générations entières de résidents. Près de 127 millions de Soviétiques, à travers toute l’URSS, y ont vécu, selon le journaliste indépendant Iouri Bolotov.

De façon tout aussi arbitraire, ils en dressent des typologies distinguant le normal du pathologique. Certains hymens sont jugés conformes, d’autres pas. L’absence d’hymen, par exemple, relève de la difformité. En vertu de quels critères ? «Lorsque le discours scientifique s’en saisit – et en particulier au XIXe siècle, où les théories médicales se basent sur la multiplication des observations et des statistiques –, le fréquent devient le normal», note Pauline Mortas qui dénonce la confusion entre la moyenne et la normalité d’une part, le rare et l’anomalie d’autre part. Gare aux femmes qui sortent du lot. Les voilà estampillées handicapées, même si la forme de leur hymen ne présente en soi aucun risque pour la santé et ne gêne ni les rapports sexuels, ni la grossesse. De façon très révélatrice, parmi les hymens classés «anormaux» certains savants classent ceux qui peuvent laisser croire à des déchirures ou des viols : ce sont les hymens dits frangés ou infundibuliformes, dont l’aspect par trop douteux ne correspond pas à l’hymen idéal des médecins : celui qui indique clairement si une femme est vierge. Car c’est bien de cela qu’il est question lorsque les savants inventent l’hymen : ils inventent l’idée selon laquelle un bout de chair servirait de «preuve» tangible de la virginité.

You e-mailed asking for my opinion, and I wanted to give a really thorough, well-thought-out, articulate response, so I starred your e-mail, and over time it became a mascot for my illogical but oppressive sense of dread in the face of slightly annoying tasks. That little yellow star became a shining testament to the burden of modernity! Every day, it dared me to write a response worthy of the time I’ve made you wait, and every day I thought, Ugh, no. But today! Today I will respond! Rejoice, my patient friend! (I’m actually really busy, though, so this is going to be a vague, half-assed response that I could have easily written in the minute after I first read your e-mail, five months ago.) Sorry!

He spots the power plant’s offshore cooling water intakes and outflows that are creating abstract, expressionist patterns in the mudflats and sea. “That tells me they are dumping hot water into the bay which is going to affect the marine life. What about its waste coal ash? Where does all that go?” he asks.

Back on the ground, Fair says his environmental images must be both meaningful and beautiful to work. “Art that is beautiful but not meaningful is decoration. Art that is meaningful without beauty is pedantic. I want to make art that tells a story to regular people; art which hopefully gives them an insight into our world.

“What we buy doesn’t come with information about the hidden costs: the air that is fouled, the water contaminated, the habitat destroyed, or the workers exploited. But these are real costs that must inevitably be paid, a burden that ultimately falls on all of us.”

Consider a student who always starts her homework the moment it’s assigned.  What might look like an admirable display of self-discipline, given that there are other things she’d rather be doing, may actually be due to an acute discomfort with having anything unfinished.  She wants – or, more accurately, needs – to get the assignment out of the way in order to stave off anxiety.  (The fact that something resembling self-discipline is required to complete a task doesn’t bode well for the likelihood of deriving any intellectual benefit from it.  Learning, after all, depends not on what students do so much as on how they regard and construe what they do.  To assume otherwise is to revert to a crude behaviorism long since repudiated by serious scholars.)

More generally, self-discipline can be less a sign of health than of vulnerability.  It may reflect a fear of being overwhelmed by external forces, or by one’s own desires, that must be suppressed through continual effort.  In effect, such individuals suffer from a fear of being out of control.  In his classic work Neurotic Styles, David Shapiro described how someone might function as “his own overseer, issuing commands, directives, reminders, warnings, and admonitions concerning not only what is to be done and what is not to be done, but also what is to be wanted, felt, and even thought.”  Secure, healthy people can be playful, flexible, open to new experiences and self-discovery, deriving satisfaction from the process rather than always focused on the product.  An extremely self-disciplined student, by contrast, may see reading or problem-solving purely as a means to the end of a good test score or a high grade.  In Shapiro’s more general formulation, such people “do not feel comfortable with any activity that lacks an aim or a purpose beyond its own pleasure, and usually they do not recognize the possibility of finding life satisfying without a continuous sense of purpose and effort.”

In dem Dorf in der deindustrialisierten Picardie, über das ich meinen ersten Roman Das Ende von Eddy geschrieben habe, herrschten Arbeitslosigkeit, Elend, Alkohol, Gewalt, eine brutale Männlichkeit. In diesem Milieu, aus dem auch Bourdieu stammt, ist Politik eine Frage von Leben und Tod. Man spürt sie am lebendigen Leibe: in der medizinischen Versorgung, beim Essen, im sexuellen Alltag. Die politischen Fragen heißen: Gehe ich zum Arzt, wenn ich krank bin? Gibt es heute Abend etwas zu essen? Kann ich sexueller Gewalt entkommen? Mein Vater ist zum ersten Mal in seinem Leben zum Zahnarzt gegangen, als ich 14 Jahre alt war, weil der Staat eine Beihilfe geschaffen hatte. Es gab Tage in meiner Kindheit, da hat meine Mutter gesagt: “Heute gibt es zum Essen nur Milch.” Ich gehe wählen, damit die körperliche Not und Gewalt aufhört. Das Wahlrecht ist für mich dabei ein politisches Instrument unter vielen.

Une langue unique, cela n’existe pas, à moins de robotiser les humains ! On a toujours créé de la diversité. Et puis, cette idée qu’une société ne peut fonctionner que si on s’exprime tous exactement de la même façon est fausse. A l’école, on parle de l’importance de la «maîtrise de la langue». Ce mot «maîtrise» est chargé de sens. Comme s’il était question de la dompter, de la domestiquer à la manière d’un animal sauvage. Nous avons un rapport très particulier à la langue, de l’ordre du totem, d’un symbole absolu de l’identité nationale. C’est presque une religion. Je pèse mes mots. 

Un exemple. Lors du débat parlementaire sur la déchéance de la nationalité, il y a quelques semaines, une députée a tweeté : «Respecter la France, c’est d’abord respecter sa langue…» L’attachement à la langue est de l’ordre du sacré, ancré dans la tête des gens dès l’école. Ce qui explique d’ailleurs que la plupart l’acceptent, jouent le jeu, renoncent à leur langue régionale ou immigrée, à leur accent régional ou social, changent leur manière de parler, les mots qu’ils emploient en se disant ne pas avoir le choix. L’idéologie est tellement prégnante qu’on transpose cette pression sur les langues étrangères. On va par exemple collectivement considérer que bien parler l’anglais, c’est s’exprimer avec l’accent de la bourgeoisie londonienne. Comme si c’était le seul accent valable ! Alors que vous pouvez parler l’anglais à votre façon, les anglophones ne donneront pas d’importance à votre accent.

One of the sneakier pitfalls of an efficiency-based attitude to time is that we start to feel pressured to use our leisure time “productively”, too – an attitude which implies that enjoying leisure for its own sake, which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure, is somehow not quite enough. And so we find ourselves, for example, travelling to unfamiliar places not for the sheer experience of travel, but in order to add to our mental storehouse of experiences, or to our Instagram feeds. We go walking or running to improve our health, not for the pleasure of movement; we approach the tasks of parenthood with a fixation on the successful future adults we hope to create.

In his 1962 book The Decline of Pleasure, the critic Walter Kerr noticed this shift in our experience of time: “We are all of us compelled to read for profit, party for contracts, lunch for contacts … and stay home for the weekend to rebuild the house.” Even rest and recreation, in a culture preoccupied with efficiency, can only be understood as valuable insofar as they are useful for some other purpose – usually, recuperation, so as to enable more work. (Several conference guests mentioned Arianna Huffington’s current crusade to encourage people to get more sleep; for her, it seems, the main point of rest is to excel at the office.)

The standard view is that the switch to an energy system based on renewables will take at least half a century.

This opinion is largely derived from Professor Vaclav Smil's work on previous transitions from one fuel to another. We have all gone on to assume that the future will be like the past.

In contrast, I argue that the growth of solar PV, in particular, will not be restrained by the forces that held back new fuels in the past. Of course, nobody actually knows how rapid the growth of renewables will be but my purpose in this note is to suggest that Smil's view may be incomplete and that solar and wind will continue to grow at far faster rates than he suggests are possible.

One thing is that mother trees suckle their children, they feed the young tree just enough sugars produced by its own photosynthesis to keep it from dying. Trees in a forest of the same species are connected by the roots, which grow together like a network. Their root tips have highly sensitive brain-like structures that can distinguish whether the root that it encounters in the soil is its own root, the root of another species, or the roots of its own species. If it encounters its own kind, I don’t know if scientists yet know how this happens, but we have measured with radioactive-marked sugar molecules that there is a flow from healthy trees to sick trees so that they will have an equal measure of food and energy available.

(…) We have this essentially arbitrary caste system for living beings. We say plants are the lowest caste, the pariahs because they don’t have brains, they don’t move, they don’t have big brown eyes. Flies and insects have eyes, so they are a bit higher, but not so high as monkeys and apes and so on. I want to remove trees from this caste system. This hierarchical ranking of living beings is totally unscientific. Plants process information just as animals do, but for the most part they do this much more slowly. Is life in the slow lane worth less than life on the fast track?

A common myth, promoted by the rich, is that wealth is produced individually before it is collectivized by the state, through taxation. In fact, wealth was always produced collectively and privatized by those with the power to do it: the propertied class. Farmland and seeds, pre-modern forms of capital, were collectively developed through generations of peasant endeavor that landlords appropriated by stealth. Today, every smartphone comprises components developed by some government grant, or through the commons of pooled ideas, for which no dividends have ever been paid to society.

so how should society be compensated? Taxation is the wrong answer. Corporations pay taxes in exchange for services the state provides them, not for capital injections that must yield dividends. There is thus a strong case that the commons have a right to a share of the capital stock, and associated dividends, reflecting society’s investment in corporations’ capital. And, because it is impossible to calculate the size of state and social capital crystalized in any firm, we can decide how much of its capital stock the public should own only by means of a political mechanism.

The numbers can be confusing but the thrust was clear. The big idea, in design terms, was to return to a more traditional streetscape and more suburban style of architecture. The stated aim of the Peckham Partnership was to ‘provide family houses and a neighbourhood environment which encourages study, work, leisure and healthy living’. The architect Will Alsop praised the new build’s ‘more traditional type of architecture with pitched roofs’ and a circulation around its buildings which felt ‘much safer and…more embracing’.

To Pollard Thomas & Edwards, the previous renovations, which involved the removal of walkways and partial demolitions but had left the basic layout of North Peckham intact, had been inadequate: the ‘homes themselves were fine, it was the bits in between that were disastrous’. The new scheme, they claimed, would create a legible street pattern and a link between the shops and amenities of Peckham High Street and Burgess Park.

This was ‘back to the future’ with a vengeance, echoing all the tropes of the contemporary ‘defensible space’ movement which emphasised the ‘natural surveillance’ of the streets and the need to increase private space and reduce twilight zones of semi-public space.

This 11-mile stretch is one of the only places that defied the Army Corps’ Depression-era efforts at control. The bottom of the river was so soft that the concrete would not stick. As a result, this section of river is a purling, cobble- and rock-studded waterway with swimming mallards, blue herons, and cormorants atop boulders drying their outstretched wings. Both banks, though, form a massive concrete trough.

Still, nature finds a way. It turns out that water sheeting over the concrete grows algae that are an important foraging habitat for shorebirds. Indeed, on the day I visited, a black-necked stilt was working these hard bottom shallows.

(…) Historical ecology — the study of old photos, maps, and diary accounts — will provide a sense of what the river once looked like, including the wildlife and plant species present. This will help guide restoration. “It gives you a sense of options for the future,” Parker says.

Blogging’s a lot of effort for scant reward, so if hardly anybody’s reading what you write, why bother? Alternative platforms have taken hold, and take far less effort to update, and get instant feedback. Self-broadcasting is no clique any more, it’s a universal collective, which leaves those of us who still create long-form prose down something of a cul-de-sac. Indeed images have already overtaken text for most, as people spend their days looking at photos of their mates, watching videos of comical kittens, capturing their food on Instagram, making conversation by appending snapshots from TV shows, and responding via emoji. Why bother writing anything, quite frankly, when nobody has time for anything more than swiftly digestible visual nuggets?

(…) Most importantly, new readers no longer come clicking via a long-standing blogroll in a sidebar. Instead they arrive via a one-off reference on social media, if they turn up at all, because Twitter and Facebook are very much in charge these days. A blog is now only as good as its last post, and long-term reputation counts for almost nothing. I’m very much aware that my daily readership is now almost exclusively people who arrived here once and stayed, and all too rarely fresh blood directed in from elsewhere.

The service of Loophole for All acquires the lists of companies incorporated in the offshore centers and armed with as little as a company name and a number, lets people hijack those companies and utilize them for public advantage.

This corporate identity theft benefits from the anonymous nature of those offshore companies. Everyone can pretend to be them because of their real owners’ secrecy. And even if it’s illegal to steal an identity of a company, the courts of offshoring centers don’t have any power or credibility onshore. And meanwhile, onshore authorities don’t have the resources to verify the real owners of companies offshore — even less to chase everybody down.

Society is built on interfaces. You take a complex thing, put it inside a sturdy box, and put some simple buttons on the box so that people can use the thing inside. The box makes it easier to use and prevents people from breaking it. For example, you can take the machinery of a clock, put it in a box, and put two hands on the outside along with a knob for winding it. Take all the machinery of a car, hide it behind a dashboard, and give people two pedals and wheel. Take all the circuits of a computer, put them in a box, and give people a monitor and a keyboard.

Interfaces receive input and produce output, and that’s all we need to know. The clock gets wound, and its hands show the time. Input and output. As far as the user needs to know, what happens inside the box is magic. This allows stupid and ignorant people to use complicated things, as long as the interface inputs and outputs are simple.

Toyota uses millions of kilograms of steel every year. Does the CEO of Toyota know how to make steel from scratch? If he wanted to beat a guy up, could he go digging in the ground for some ore and whip himself up a batch of steel to make a pipe? No. He uses interfaces to get steel. He buys steel from an steelmaking company. Except he doesn’t personally go down to the steelmaking company with a bag full of Yen, saying, “How much for a million kilos?” He uses a bank. Except he doesn’t even personally go to the bank. He has a subordinate who does it for him. All these people and institutions are interfaces he can use. He employs a system of layered interfaces, both metaphorical and literal, to control things he doesn’t really understand. We all do. The point is this: don’t go messing with the CEO of Toyota. I assure you, he could get his hands on a steel pipe if he wanted.

Once thought to be the most densely populated place on Earth, with 50,000 people crammed into only a few blocks, these fascinating pictures give a rare insight into the lives of those who lived Kowloon Walled City.

Taken by Canadian photographer Greg Girard in collaboration with Ian Lamboth the pair spent five years familiarising themselves with the notorious Chinese city before it was demolished in 1992.

The city was a phenomenon with 33,000 families and businesses living in more than 300 interconnected high-rise buildings, all constructed without contributions from a single architect.

Bolstered by these and other relevant prejudices, I managed to ward off “Game of Thrones” for months. Then a box of the first season somehow got into the house. It lay there unopened on the parlor table while I thought of further objections. For yet another thing, “Game of Thrones” had Sean Bean as a hero, when everybody knows that Sean Bean is meant to be a heavy, one who flexes his teeth and grits his jaw before being eliminated by Christian Bale in “Equilibrium” or Harrison Ford in “Patriot Games.”

How do we know when a photographer caters to life and not to some previous prejudice? One clue is when the picture evades compositional cliché. But there is also the question of what the photograph is for, what role it plays within the economic circulation of images. Some photographs, like Singh’s, are freer of the censorship of the market. Others are taken only to elicit particular conventional responses — images that masquerade as art but fully inhabit the vocabulary of advertising. As Justice Potter Stewart said when pressed to define hard-core pornography in 1964, “I know it when I see it.”

For black Gen-Xers like myself, who witnessed past scenes of black torture caught on camera, like the beating of motorist Rodney King by LAPD officers back in 1991, this is a moment in which the truth of black death and incarceration feels both familiar and utterly new. We are more than accustomed to managing our fury and incredulity about the insult of racial violence and its casual, chronic erasure from the public conversation. What is harder to process is seeing the faces and hearing the stories of the dead in great detail from surviving family members grappling with unspeakable pain. We who watch these daily tragedies unfold on our phones and laptops and cable news watch from afar but feel the sad heaviness of what it means to experience one’s blackness as precarious and unprotected, as eviscerated of its citizenship. To live like that is to walk through the world always slightly numb and sceptical of what lies ahead.

As a child, Mabey hadn’t studied botany, having little feeling for plants in a conventional scientific sense. “But the idea of an entanglement between human culture and the natural world like that struck some chord in me. I thought it was a terrific story and I was quite sure there would be more examples round Britain. So I invented this book.

(…) “I believe in microcosmic views,” he says. “They seem to me not just powerful metaphors, but actually the nano-bricks for rebuilding things. This is where it starts. There is such a multitude of things going on round here at a local level. I’m kept an optimist by that.”

What becomes absolutely critical I think in rethinking Malthus is what he says about this. This process of removing people off land in order to make space for British Europeans is something that troubled him deeply. So he says at various points in a couple of chapters, especially the chapters where he’s talking about North America but not only, that the original inhabitants should not be driven into a corner he says, where they will starve. That this is an exercise, that this is an outcome that cannot be considered for an instant. So Malthus in 1803 was deeply troubled by the process by which land would and people, would be cleared in order to make space for the cultivation of grain. And this is something that he thinks about most directly with respect to North America. Not something that he yet thinks about with respect to the colony of New South Wales because it was not yet in 1803 really, there was no pastoral expansion as yet. It’s quite interesting that Malthus doesn’t imagine the continent of Australia as yet available for pastoral expansion. He understands it for what it was at that point, which was a very local coastal settlement.

So this whole question of what happens to original occupants of various New World lands is something that he’s concerned about with respect to the American instance in particular. And it’s that he has, not that many but three or four times in the early, in these early chapters of the Essay, he’s quite clear that driving natives into a corner which is the way he puts it, is an extremely problematic undertaking and something that he says we should not consider for an instant. And that Malthus has often over the years been understood, often in a very knee jerk way as essentially a conservative, this is not what we expect, the received Malthus to have said.

The rise of the New Brutalism was an expression of this discrepancy in sensibilities, and the new appetite for coarse textures and raw materials—as opposed to the sleek machine finishes sought during the 1920s—was a tentative first step toward bringing architecture into harmony with the other arts. The critic Reyner Banham made this point in an important 1955 article in the Architectural Review published in December 1955: “In the last resort what characterizes the New Brutalism in architecture as in painting is precisely its brutality, its je-m’en-foutisme, its bloody-mindedness.” 

(…) For more than a generation now, architecture has aspired to a state of absolute sleekness, in which materials have no weight and surfaces no texture. The practice of designing by computer—not only preparing drawings but conceiving them on the computer screen, and gauging their visual qualities there—has accelerated the process to the point where most buildings give the impression of having been put together through a cold, analytical process, without any feeling for the physicality of materials.

In those days the mark of the beast was clearly imprinted on the ravished terrain between the A13 and the river: discontinued industries, generic towers rising on the malign compost of the deregulated financial markets, crude surveillance systems protecting speculative retail parks. ‘Don’t you know there’s a war on?’ The repeated challenge as security guards questioned me at every imposed barrier. Thatcher was an abiding presence. Like the smell of the Thames: oil and river-rot and yellow mud. Along walls and embankments, the rabid slogans and anti-Thatcher curses were large and scarlet. In certain hideaway pubs, inscribed photographs in polished frames signalled a positive allegiance. Now, from the window of the empty train to Tilbury, there was nothing. No acknowledgment of funeral or legacy. Margaret Thatcher’s traces were visible in every new shed, in every mushroom estate under a pergola of pylons, but she was forgotten.

“They are pretty surreal environments,” he continued. “The absence of people helps you understand the scale of the places, even if they’re not fully built out.

Almost everyone I know is busy. They feel anxious and guilty when they aren’t either working or doing something to promote their work. They schedule in time with friends the way students with 4.0 G.P.A.’s  make sure to sign up for community service because it looks good on their college applications. I recently wrote a friend to ask if he wanted to do something this week, and he answered that he didn’t have a lot of time but if something was going on to let him know and maybe he could ditch work for a few hours. I wanted to clarify that my question had not been a preliminary heads-up to some future invitation; this was the invitation. But his busyness was like some vast churning noise through which he was shouting out at me, and I gave up trying to shout back over it.

Identified as a submerged microcontinent by a team of scientists in 1999, the Kerguelen Plateau was built up by eruptions from the hotspot over the next 20 million years before emerging above sea level. A rather quick event in geologic time, the sudden eruption of the plateau may have contributed to a global catastrophe at that time in the form of a global oceanic anoxic event, in which the earth’s oceans are deprived of oxygen and marine life dies off en masse; interestingly, much of the world’s petroleum resources credit their origins to the massive marine extinctions of this time period.
    
The plateau existed above water as a microcontinent three different times over a period of 80 million years before it went underwater for a final time about 20 million years ago; a combination of a change in characteristics in the mantle plume which fed Kerguelen’s construction, sea level change, and the inevitable process of erosion (the same reason the northwesternmost Hawaiian Islands are so much smaller than the southeasternmost islands; they’re older). Floor samples indicate that the microcontinent was covered by a coniferous forest.

A recent infographic in The Economist revealed that in the 140 million hours humanity spent watching “Gangnam Style” on YouTube two billion times, we could have built at least four more (desperately needed) pyramids at Giza. Endless articles pose the question of why we procrastinate, what’s going wrong in the brain, how to overcome it, and the fascinating irrationality of it all.

But if procrastination is so clearly a society-wide, public condition, why is it always framed as an individual, personal deficiency? Why do we assume our own temperaments and habits are at fault — and feel bad about them — rather than question our culture’s canonization of productivity?

(…) While passive-aggressive personality disorder has been erased from the official portion of the manual, the stigma of slothfulness remains. Many of us, it seems, are still trying to enforce a military-style precision on our intellectual, creative, civilian lives — and often failing.

(…) Oblomov could conduct the few tasks he cared to from under his quilt — writing letters, accepting visitors — but what if he’d had an iPhone and a laptop? Being in bed is now no excuse for dawdling, and no escape from the guilt that accompanies it. The voice — societal or psychological — urging us away from sloth to the pure, virtuous heights of productivity has become a sort of birdlike shriek as more individuals work from home and set their own schedules, and as the devices we use for work become alluring sirens to our own distraction. We are now able to accomplish tasks at nearly every moment, even if we prefer not to.

Certes, la proximité géographique est très souvent une variable importante. Mais pourquoi devrait-elle être la seule ? Instister sur la co-présence dévalorise toutes les autres formes de proximité. Etre proche géographiquement de quelqu’un (partager une même pièce) ne signifie pas pour autant qu’on prenne activement soin de lui, qu’on l’écoute, qu’on l’apprécie ou qu’on partage des choses avec lui.

Affirmer que la proximité géographique est la seule façon qu’ont les humains pour être proches est une manière d’affirmer une suprématie morale des rapports traditionnels, physiques. Cela induit que le statu quo est la seule solution aux problèmes qu’engendre parfois le numérique.

There are addendums sometimes, add-ons like “I’m happy to see POC characters if the plot calls for it” or “why put in a black dude in the cast just because?” Understand what is being said there: the story that is universal is white. The default is always white. The POC character only makes it in there “when the role calls for it”. Let that sink in for a moment. Our presence in popular culture (and in non-stereotypical roles) must always be justified, but whiteness exists as the basic template. Our place at the table has to be earned. And ain’t that a kick in the teeth?

The longer I stay here the easier it is to understand why North Americans of my generation, raised on positive reinforcement and dreams of creative fulfillment, are especially drawn to Berlin. This place allows you to escape the harsh realities of adulthood, to avoid confronting the limits of your specialness. In New York, most people I knew were working 12-hour days at bad jobs not only because they needed to make rent, but because they wanted to fit in. Here, you’re free to describe yourself as a “performance artist” or a “graphic designer,” even if you spend your entire day surfing the Internet, because, for the most part, you’re not expected to do anything at all. This aspect of the Berlin lifestyle is sometimes referred to in magazines trend pieces as “downshifting.” A less charitable German would call it “sozialverträgliche Faulheit.”

(…) Not long ago, the graffiti next to my front door began to change. The “fuck off” in “Tourists fuck off” was crossed out, and replaced with “Tourists welcome and bring your parents.” Then the whole thing was covered with a scribble of blue paint, except the word “Tourist.”

Thank goodness, I think, every time I walk past it. My neighbors, it turns out, are just as conflicted as I am.

One of the Humboldt squid’s more “attention-grabbing behaviors” is rapidly flashing nearly its entire body from red to white to red again, says Hannah Rosen, a doctoral student at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Actual light, like bioluminescence, isn’t involved.

The animals can speed up or slow down their flashes to send different messages. But researchers have no idea what the squid are trying to say—maybe they’re broadcasting come-ons to prospective mates, or throwing down with potential rivals. “That is the question of the hour,” says Rosen, the lead study author.

La première, c’est la solitude. A l’époque de Defoe, la solitude n’existait pas. Le tissu social était extrêmement serré, la pauvreté engendrait la solidarité et on envoyait marginaux et caractériels se faire dresser à l’armée. La solitude, c’est un symptôme moderne, un luxe de pays riches et libres. Aujourd’hui, même les foules sont formées d’un agglomérat de gens seuls qui, par aberration, se gênent physiquement – regardez par exemple, dans les embouteillages, les conducteurs enfermés qui s’insultent les uns les autres…

La deuxième, c’est l’irruption de Vendredi. Robinson est anglais, rouquin, blanc de peau, chrétien, et il voit débouler dans son univers un nègre, nu, animiste, peut-être même anthropophage sur les bords… Il est brutalement confronté à l’Autre, à la différence ; il est partagé sur la conduite à tenir, l’utiliser et le rejeter, l’assimiler et le mépriser… Comment mieux énoncer le problème du tiers-monde, des immigrés, des sans-papiers qui viennent sans cesse frapper à la porte des pays riches ?

La dernière chose que Defoe ne pouvait pas prévoir, c’est la séduction qu’exercent sur l’homme d’aujourd’hui l’île déserte, la plage de sable blond, le retour aux sources, tout ce côté Club Med et rêve stéréotypé propre aux pays qui discutent de réduction du temps de travail et d’aménagement des loisirs.

Another layer for me that I got really interested in is that we always have this thing about making the other dangerous. So I started reading these books. I read this book on sea monsters. The 16th and 17th century maps, they didn’t understand the ocean, so it was a deep, dark, mysterious place. In these books of these sea monsters, they were half dolphins and half walruses. They had names for them. They had categories. I just became so fascinated by this. I just thought: this is so cool. What they didn’t understand, they made terrifying. Although they needed these routes to exploit, they also started putting in, like, ‘Well, be careful of these waters because they’re full of sea monsters.’ But a lot of it was actually just a marketing strategy by the mapmakers to discourage other explorers from taking those routes.

Against that monomaniacal bully, the singular origin of the text, Barthes liked to champion the reader, a delightfully many-headed, depersonalised vessel in which references and texts and ideas could chase each other around and never have to settle. And who is this free and easy reader, so full of contradictions, following possible meanings where they lead “like a run in the stocking”? You suspect it might be Barthes himself, and that as time went on, he started to suspect so, too. After all, authors, if they’re any good, are readers first: that’s why Barthes loved collecting fragments, aphorisms and citations, and making lists of books he’d never need to actually write. The reader-writer doesn’t have to be God, or daddy, or to stay under the thumb of either.

It’s interesting because her books do seem very readable in Italian. There are occasional weird idiomatic expressions that are Neapolitan words. She talks so much about people’s use of language. She tells us when someone’s speaking in dialect. She talks about how when Lila wants to, she can speak in a beautiful, educated type of Italian. We don’t really get examples of this, but Ferrante says, “She spoke like this,” or every once in awhile Elena will also fall into dialect. There’s this moment where she no longer wants to speak in dialect, it feels strange to her, but then sometimes she can go back into it. The obvious reason Ferrante doesn’t use dialect is because many Italians wouldn’t understand it. But a second reason may be that, as an Italian professor at CUNY was saying, Neapolitan dialect is very much a spoken language, and if she were writing it, there would be no point, in a way. It would lose the character that it has as a spoken language.

In writing, habit seems to be a much stronger force than either willpower or inspiration. Consequently there must be some little quality of fierceness until the habit pattern of a certain number of words is established. There is no possibility, in me at least, of saying, “I’ll do it if I feel like it.” One never feels like awaking day after day. In fact, given the smallest excuse, one will not work at all. The rest is nonsense. Perhaps there are people who can work that way, but I cannot. I must get my words down every day whether they are any good or not.

A few years ago, after CBT had started to dominate taxpayer-funded therapy in Britain, a woman I’ll call Rachel, from Oxfordshire, sought therapy on the NHS for depression, following the birth of her first child. She was sent first to sit through a group PowerPoint presentation, promising five steps to “improve your mood”; then she received CBT from a therapist and, in between sessions, via computer.

“I don’t think anything has ever made me feel as lonely and isolated as having a computer program ask me how I felt on a scale of one to five, and – after I’d clicked the sad emoticon on the screen – telling me it was ‘sorry to hear that’ in a prerecorded voice,” Rachel recalled. Completing CBT worksheets under a human therapist’s guidance wasn’t much better.

“With postnatal depression,” she said, “you’ve gone from a situation in which you’ve been working, earning your own money, doing interesting things – and suddenly you’re at home on your own, mostly covered in sick, with no adult to talk to.” What she needed, she sees now, was real connection: that fundamental if hard-to-express sense of being held in the mind of another person, even if only for a short period each week.

Non. La gauche benjaminienne parie sur le seul geste de « saisir le frein d’urgence ».

Saisir le frein d’urgence ?

Over time, certain cries became widely adopted, and it is in written accounts and songbooks that we find the earliest records. Print collections of pictures of criers also became known as “Cries”, and although the oldest set in London dates from around 1600, there are those from Paris which predate these by a century. Characteristically, the Cries represented peripatetic street traders or pedlars, yet other street characters were also included from the start. At first, the Cries were supplemented by the bellman and the town crier, but then preachers, beggars, musicians and performers were added as the notion of the Cries of London became expanded by artists and print sellers seeking greater novelty through elaborating upon the original premise.

Dans les sociétés industrielles, le pouvoir portait essentiellement sur le contrôle des biens, des capitaux, des matériaux, des machines. Bref, sur le contrôle du monde de l’objectivité. Avec l’émergence des technologies de l’information et de la communication, il se passe quelque chose d’inouï : ce sont des technologies de construction et de transformation de la subjectivité qui permettent d’agir sur l’acteur humain lui-même. L’enjeu du pouvoir devient ainsi de contrôler, de transformer, de fabriquer les esprits. L’idée n’est pas neuve, évidemment. Nous avons connu, au XXe siècle, l’expérience du totalitarisme dont l’objectif était également le contrôle des esprits par la parole, l’image, la mise en scène ou le culte de la personnalité. Et par la répression de toute opposition. Je n’affirme évidemment pas que nous vivons tous aujourd’hui dans des sociétés totalitaires. Mais j’avance l’idée que le pouvoir devient total.

(…) L’après-guerre a été dominée par la mise à mort du « sujet », d’un côté par les structuralistes, de l’autre par les marxistes. Je veux le réhabiliter. Et brandir comme un drapeau la « subjectivation » qui est, pour chacun, la prise en charge du sujet en lui, le mouvement par lequel un individu se transforme en acteur social capable de promouvoir et de défendre les droits humains fondamentaux, universels, quand ceux-ci sont bafoués.

The problem that Sapphire and Steel have come to solve is, as ever, to do with time. At the service station, there is temporal bleed-through from earlier periods: images and figures from 1925 and 1948 keep appearing, so that, as Sapphire and Steel’s colleague Silver puts it ‘time just got mixed, jumbled up, together, making no sort of sense’. Anachronism, the slippage of discrete time periods into one another, was throughout the series the major symptom of time breaking down.

(…) In this final assignment, the anachronism has led to stasis: time has stopped. The service station is in ‘a pocket, a vacuum’. There’s ‘still traffic, but it’s not going anywhere’: the sound of cars is locked into a looped drone. Silver says, ‘there is no time here, not any more’.

(…) Hammond said that he had not necessarily intended the series to end there. He had thought that it would be rested, to return at some point in the future. There would be no return – at least, not on network television.

(…) Eternally suspended, never to be freed, their plight – and indeed their provenance – never to be fully explained, Sapphire and Steel’s internment in this café from nowhere prophetic for a general condition: in which life continues, but time has somehow stopped.

There are relations between department store and museum, and here the bazaar provides a link.

The result might seem counterintuitive. Indeed, Hewstone told me, other academic experts thought their conclusions were “bonkers”. But as a disciple of Tajfel, Hewstone had always recognised the centrality of group membership to identity. These days, his findings are widely accepted: for group prejudice to be eroded, group identity has to be maintained. In other words, contact itself is not enough.

Positive contact between members of antagonistic groups will improve how members of these groups generally see each other only if the people involved are seen as representative of their group. For contact to work, one does not want to put individuals through some kind of identity blender, to produce a homogeneous group. The aim is that people can see other people precisely as “other” and then realise that other isn’t bad.

Modesty, thrift and restraint – the key bourgeois values – were to be encouraged, though recidivists would lapse into ‘a blaze of colour’. Philanthropic landlords with model estates, or paternalist industrialists like Cadbury at Bournville, where the gardens were generously supplied with the shrubs and flowers, were relentless in their rules and regulations, as were the enlightened municipal authorities that were then building the first council houses. On the Wythenshawe estate in Manchester ‘slum habits’, such as putting up a trellis for unruly sweet peas too close to the path, could land you in trouble. The lower orders soon learned to police themselves.

Middlesex Street, ‘Petticoat Lane’, is full of public housing, from interwar tenements to a remarkable mini-Barbican of walkways and towers. It’s a sudden plunge right into real London, and vies with Poplar for the sharpest meeting of rich and poor in Europe. These places were largely owned by the LCC, now Tower Hamlets, and hence are left to rot. The City’s own postwar housing projects, however, are still a revelation. It’s incredible at this distance to think that the City could have paid for Golden Lane, for instance, a place where evidently some of London’s working class manage to live well next to architects who are paying over the odds for the same flats. The Barbican, into which it imperceptibly fades along Goswell Lane, is a more complicated proposition, never public housing in the strict sense, although certainly not intended as the luxury enclave it is now. The Barbican, aside from the sheer pleasure of its Brutalist-Baroque grandeur, is mainly of use for deflecting every anti-modernist, anti-urban shibboleth going – a high density arrangement of towers and walkways, without an inch of ‘defensible space’, in beefy raw concrete, that is doing very well thank you (it’s also, like the City itself, a wonderful place to get yourself deliberately lost on a Sunday).

Joining the evangelists on these routes across Asia were military leaders, merchants and learned men. Modern Chinese words derived from Persian and Arabic, such as bosi, meaning a precious object (literally “from Persia”), are evidence of the booming markets and wealth in the Muslim world in the early Middle Ages, as vast tax revenues flowed towards Baghdad and the great cities of Mesopotamia and central Asia. Scholars were drawn by systems of patronage that gathered the best minds to work on pure and applied mathematics, science, optics and medicine, while great craftsmen found an insatiable demand for their wares. A place such as Rayy, not far from modern Tehran, was so glorious as to be considered “the bridegroom of the earth”. Cities, strung like pearls across the spine of Asia, flourished long after the discovery of the Americas: the moment usually presumed to have marked the true start of the ascent of the West.

Calvert drew most of the pictograms in the friendly, curvaceous style of Transport. Many of her illustrations were inspired by aspects of her own life. The cow featured in the triangular sign warning drivers to watch out for farm animals on the road was based on Patience, a cow on her relatives’ Warwickshire farm. Eager to make the school children crossing sign more accessible, she replaced the image of a boy in a school cap leading a little girl, with one of a girl – modelled on a photograph of herself as a child – with a younger boy. Calvert described the old sign as being: “quite archaic, almost like an illustration from Enid Blyton… I wanted to make it more inclusive because comprehensives were starting up.”

This is not to say that communities of color have not articulated a desire for and developed noteworthy urban agriculture projects. Often under the banner of “food justice,” activists attempt to use sustainable local food systems not only to create environmental sustainability and community, but to address racial and economic inequalities (Alkon and Agyeman 2011, Gottlieb and Joshi 2011). Detroit’s D-Town Farms and the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, for example, are noteworthy for their longstanding community leadership and their emphasis on creating economic and food security in the black community (White 2010).

And where rent control is relatively weak, it is just one factor affecting the supply of new housing: for example, zoning laws generally treat apartments as an undesirable use, and thus may restrain housing supply far more aggressively than moderate rent control. Conversely, if government allows lots of new housing construction, new housing will be built as long as rent control is not so strict as to prevent it. Similarly, if government subsidizes new housing or builds new housing itself, the positive results of such construction may be more important than the effects of moderate rent control.

“Sometimes I feel as if finance has reacted to the crisis the way a motorist might after a near-accident,” said the City veteran at a small credit rating agency whose wife had almost chucked his phone into a lake at the height of the panic. “There is the adrenaline surge directly after the lucky escape, followed by the huge shock when you realise what could have happened. But as the journey continues and the scene recedes in the rear-view mirror, you tell yourself: maybe it wasn’t that bad. The memory of your panic fades, and you even begin to misremember what happened. Was it really that bad?”

He was a soft-spoken man, the sort to send a text message if he is going to be five minutes late to a meeting. But now he was really angry: “If you had told people at the height of the crisis that years later we’d have had no fundamental changes, nobody would have believed you. Such was the panic and fear. But here we are. It’s back to business as usual. We went from ‘We nearly died from this’ to ‘We survived this’.”

“We didn’t build up this technology [while] understanding the power dynamics and the very real systems of oppression that were just going to follow us online,” Sarkeesian says. “One of the profound things the feminist movement and the civil rights movement did was to change the systems we live in. They didn’t stop every individual being sexist or racist, but they changed the systems that we participated in, so you couldn’t be that way in certain environments.”

So, while it’s no longer acceptable for a boss to smack a female employee’s behind at work – and we can thank feminism for that – men are still getting rewarded with social status online for abusing women. We haven’t figured out how to change that system. At least, not yet.

Other scholars have variously described the ‘knight v snail’ motif as a representation of the struggles of the poor against an oppressive aristocracy, a straightforward statement of the snail’s troublesome reputation as a garden pest, a commentary on social climbers, or even as a saucy symbol of female sexuality.  It is possible that these images could have meant all these things and more at one time or another; it is important to remember, as Michael Camille, who devoted a number of pages to this subject, once wrote: ‘marginal imagery lacks the iconographic stability of a religious narrative or icon’.

Kodandaraman is, quite literally, the last silk farmer in his village. Everyone his age and younger has moved on to jobs with small private companies in Bengaluru and beyond. For Kodandaraman too, the travails of the present season have pushed him to consider his alternatives to a profession where he feels there is no respect anymore. “More than money we worry about our reputations. If a bank official comes to your house then everywhere people begin to talk. It’s this loss of reputation that drives so many people to commit suicide,” he said.

With the opening of Delhi Blue Art Pottery, Singh is credited with having founded the culture of studio pottery in India. Today, potters in the national capital and their work is divided into two broad genres – the traditional village potters settled mainly in Uttam Nagar and the studio potters. But change has touched even the traditional potters hub. Har Kishan, a potter in Uttam Nagar, spent years working with boutiques to perfect the art of terracotta, which he has passed on to the other potters in the colony. After spending time at Delhi Blue Art Pottery, he is now mainly engaged in making glazed ceramic ware.

Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengal’s politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by “developers” – a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined.

That ability to look at something again, to open up a space of second thoughts, is so important to Northern Ireland, where all of your instincts have been trained by politicians and churches to go in a particular direction. Poetry seemed a way of clearing all that away. You suddenly realised there were other ways of approaching certain questions.

She knows, of course, that there are also quite a few unpleasant things in the notebooks, days of dissatisfaction, arguments, and even boredom, but that is not what matters. She does not want to give back to the past its poetry. She wants to give back to it its lost body. What is urging her on is not a desire for beauty. It is a desire for life.

But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work.

As a group of technologies, more demand for renewables means lower prices and higher quality constantly evolving for a long time to come. The resources they compete with – coal, oil and gas – follow a different pattern. If demand kept increasing, prices would go up because the newer reserves cost more to develop, such as deep sea oil. They may get cheaper through market shifts, as they have done recently, but they can’t keep getting cheaper and they can never get any better.

In that context, consider this. Renewables are, today, on the verge of being price competitive with fossil fuels – and already are in many situations. So in 10 years, maybe just five, it is a no-brainer that renewables will be significantly cheaper than fossil fuels in most places and will then just keep getting cheaper. And better.

Many early Klan members learned these traditions as children growing up among African-Americans. Many original Klansmen were raised by black elders who famously told their charges folktales and stories centered in the early African-American culture. They, as much as their black playmates, feared the revenge of “Raw Head and Bloody Bones”, witches and “the Hairy Man” for disobeying the authority of their caretakers. White children often dressed up along with black children and participated in masquerades – where they saw men dress like women and hide their identities under Spanish moss or animal skins. White children even joined in the revelry by darkening their skin to appear “colored”. All of these traditions would be later used by the early Klan as a way to intimidate African-Americans.

Let’s go back to Douwe Draaisma. Why does he describe our inability to recall the sense impressions of a few seconds before as “forgetting”? That would imply that I had “possessed” those impressions or wanted to possess them. The underlying implication is that life has less worth, less dignity, if it just, as it were, slips by. Yet even as I write now I am aware of scores of sense impressions. The position of papers, teacups, pens, phone, and books on the glass surface of my living-room table, which is also reflecting the opposite wall with its shelves and bric-a-brac and, as it happens, fresh white paint; the hum of the fridge and a distant siren, a dog barking and the sunlight bouncing off the façade across the street yellowing the cream color of my curtains. I will never be able to recall a fraction of all this tomorrow, or a year hence. Yet such perceptions are very much part of the pleasure of being here in the present as I write and without them life would be poor indeed.

(…) We do not possess the past, even that of a few moments ago, and this is hardly a cause for regret, since to do so would severely obstruct our experience of the present.

“There’s nothing more rewarding than a fresh set of problems,” Barthelme commented in a 1987 interview. He both celebrated and despaired of them, and his work essentially represents an ongoing investigation into problematic relationships – between the conflicting sides of the self; men and women; races and societies; competing ideologies; nature and technology; high and low culture; language and meaning – and a sustained attempt to carry out this investigation in an original, meaningful way.

Es gibt heute keinen Unterschied mehr zwischen Mitte-Links und Mitte-Rechts. Österreich ist da ein gutes Beispiel. Die bekannten Soziologen Anthony Giddens und Ulrich Beck meinten, das sei ein Fortschritt, die Demokratie werde reifer, wir müssen links und rechts überwinden. Dieser Meinung bin ich nicht. Konsens gefährdet die Demokratie. Wenn es keinen Unterschied mehr zwischen rechts und links gibt, fragen sich die Menschen, warum sie überhaupt wählen sollen. Dazu passt ein Slogan der spanischen Linkspartei Podemos: Wir haben eine Wahlstimme, aber keine Stimme.

(…) Meine Verteidigung des Linkspopulismus hat viel mit meiner Theorie zu tun, dazu muss ich etwas ausholen. Die Frage ist, wie man Politik versteht. Es gibt in der politischen Theorie zwei Ansätze. Einmal den assoziativen Ansatz, bei dem man davon ausgeht, dass Politik ein gemeinsames Projekt ist, bei dem man an Lösungen arbeitet, mit denen alle zufrieden sind. Beim dissoziativen Ansatz geht man aber davon aus, dass Politik immer von Konflikten bestimmt wird. Mein verstorbener Mann Ernesto Laclau und ich vertreten diese Sicht. Politischer Konflikt ist immer antagonistisch, Politik ist immer parteiisch – und die Gesellschaft ist und bleibt gespalten. Politische Identitäten sind immer kollektive Identitäten. Es gibt also immer ein “Wir” und ein “die Anderen”.

Syriza and the Spanish Podemos movement are marshaling their powers against these old systems. Their goal isn’t just to hold power, but to fundamentally alter the political culture. The cultural shift is akin to the concept of cultural hegemony as put forth by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, one of Laclau’s most prominent sources of inspiration.

When seen from that particular angle, “symbolic politics” are not inferior. Quite the opposite. In the long run, symbolic politics are the most important form of politics.

A Fata Morgana is a complex form of superior mirage that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an Italian term named after the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths.

Fata Morgana mirages significantly distort the object or objects on which they are based, often such that the object is completely unrecognizable. A Fata Morgana may be seen on land or at sea, in polar regions, or in deserts. It may involve almost any kind of distant object, including boats, islands, and the coastline.

Hasta hace poco se pensaba que modificar y automatizar un hábito requería 21 días. ¡Demasiado optimismo! Un estudio reciente de Jane Wardle, del University College de Londres, publicado en European Journal of Social Psychology, afirma que para convertir un nuevo objetivo o actividad en algo automático, de tal forma que no tengamos que tirar de fuerza de voluntad, necesitamos 66 días.

Sinceramente, ¡qué más da que sean 21 o 66! Lo interesante es que somos capaces de aprender, entrenar y modificar lo que elijamos y deseemos. El número de días es relativo. Depende de factores como la insistencia, perseverancia, habilidades, de las variables psicológicas de la personalidad y del interés. El cambio ronda en torno a los dos meses y pico. ¿Qué son dos meses en el ciclo de nuestra vida? Nada. Se necesita ese tiempo para ser capaces de dar el cambio que deseamos.

We need a new kind of stories, stories that tell us that nature is resilient and can rebound and get back to a healthier state, if we give it a chance to do so. We need stories that tell us that we can collaborate with nature, that we can, as Pope Francis has urged, be stewards and partners of the natural world rather than dominators of it. We need stories about a new kind of happiness not based on material consumption.

Since we have a pretty good understanding of the barriers, that is a good place to start. We need to flip the barriers over so they become successful strategies. Rather than something distant, communicators need to make climate change feel like something that is near, personal, and urgent. Rather than doom, we need to emphasize the opportunities that the crisis affords us.

Climate change is an opportunity for economic development — an entire energy system has to be redesigned from the wastefulness of the previous century to a much smarter mode of doing things. It’s a great opportunity to improve global collaboration and knowledge sharing and to create a more just society. So climate change is a fantastic opportunity to encourage our global humanity to emerge. We need to be talking about this.

The boundary between the nineteenth-century Orient (as the Near East used to be called) and Europe was the place where cholera was controlled. Various quarantine practices were set up every year in and around the Mecca pilgrimage, because there was constant European anxiety that this mass movement – in a place that is just adjacent to Europe – would introduce cholera into Europe itself. So that boundary, which was not an actual territorial border but, rather, an important part of how Europe defined itself in relation to its most adjacent neighbour, the Orient, was made meaningful through very specific, very grounded, practices of inspecting people, putting them in quarantine camps, and monitoring or restricting their movement.

(…) The other fascinating thing about quarantine is that it dreams of being non-porous, but in fact, quarantine lines are always leaky. Quarantine, like today’s passports and visas, is much more about letting some people through and keeping other people out, than enforcing a total border.

Of course, Cervantes brings his characters closer in than Perec, making him the more approachable writer, and perhaps the comparison should end at the layers and gamesmanship, but it is true that in each book the overriding structure is incomplete without the individually inconsequential stories running between the sheets. Perec said something like one way to read his books is laying on the couch. The truth in that statement is in the idea that to read Life A Users Manual one is best advised to put away the thoughts of the “Knight’s Tour” that gives the book its structure, not wonder whether the book is the depiction of a painting or a moment in time, but to start with the stories, for to see the forest in this case is to look closely at the trees.

All this is inseparable from the matter of Europe. After all, the essential British argument over the EU is about who does what, at what level. That’s what people will be looking at in the probably paltry results of Cameron’s self-styled renegotiation with Brussels.

But another word for such multilayered arrangements is, precisely, federalism. In fact, Cameron’s first government did an exhaustive exercise looking at all the different powers exercised by the EU – and then buried the results because they suggested the balance was really not at all bad for Britain. So here too the federal kingdom is what this transformed country needs.

Vijayaraghavan: When I talk to investors when they come to India — I probably meet five or six of them a month — they don’t understand the challenges related to scale. In India we don’t have a separate Department of Energy. There’s a separate Ministry of Power. Oil is a separate department, Coal is separate, Petroleum and Natural Gas is separate, and then you have a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, which is separate from the Ministry of Power. Though the Ministry of Renewable Energy is in charge of renewable energy, the moment the energy is generated, everything else gets handled by the Ministry of Power.

Further, in India, power is what is called a “concurrent subject.” What that means is that there are federal regulations, and each state has its own interpretation of those regulations. So what might work in one state might not be able to be replicated in another state, even from a fundamental business-model perspective.  The laws are different, the mandates are different, the grids are so different, the fees and the surcharges are different, the policies are different, and this is something that investors don’t spend enough time understanding while analyzing the business models.

Yet the same mayoralty has produced a sober document called the London Housing Design Guide, which calmly sets out some basic standards for civilised homes – minimum ceiling heights and room sizes; balconies you can actually use – which, as homes tend to last a long time once built, is an important gift to the future. It was pushed through despite opposition from developers, and with the help of mayorally supported pilot projects such as the St Andrews development in east London, and has led to an outbreak of decent, dignified housing where formerly there was junk. Some of its recommendations are now being applied to housing across the country.

At first blush, “no” does not appear to be the kind of word whose meaning you can monkey with. For one thing, there is its length. At just two letters and one syllable, it lacks the pliable properties of longer words. You can’t stuff stuff inside it. (You can say “unfreakingbelievable,” but you cannot say “nfreakingo.”) You can’t mangle it, à la “misunderestimate” or (the finest example I’ve heard lately) “haphazardous.” On the contrary, it is so simple and self-contained that it is a holophrasm, a word that can serve as a complete sentence. (Holophrasms aren’t common in English, but any verb in command form can be holophrastic—“Go,” “Help,” “Run”—and babies just learning to talk use single words to express complex ideas all the time, albeit without regard to grammar: “Ball,” “Up,” “Want.”)

Moreover, the word has the apparent fixity and clarity of a logical operator: like “if,” “then,” “and,” “or,” and “not,” “no” seems designed to be unambiguous. When we ask, in the face of excessive pestering, “What part of ‘no’ don’t you understand?,” what we mean is: “Unless you are a complete cretin, there is no part of ‘no’ that you could possibly misunderstand.”

One of the pleasures of flash fiction is the impossibility of ever finally defining what it is. From ancient times, as Mr Banks says, human beings have riddled, observed and questioned the world in ways that prove that brevity can be more than just the soul of wit—brevity leaves space for a reader’s imagination, and for imaginative depth. The fabulous and the magical find easier entry into flash fiction than into much traditionally structured narrative. Again, this recalls much older forms—those of the ballad, or the folk tale.

The prison’s defining feature, the wall is visible everywhere the inmates go, functioning as an inescapable reminder of their imprisonment. Because the prison buildings were purposely built to a human scale, with none more than two stories in height and all modest in breadth, the wall becomes an outsize presence; it looms everywhere, framed by the cell windows, shadowing the exercise yards, its pale horizontal spread emphasized by the dark vertical lines of the trees. The two primary responsibilities of the Correctional Service — detention and rehabilitation — are in perpetual tension with each other, and the architects felt that single wall could represent both. “We trusted the wall,” Molden said, to serve as a symbol and an instrument of punishment.

Ultimately, the EU is nothing like the multi-headed monster it is often made out to be. A real problem is that it is very difficult to understand – but that is precisely because the structure tries to maintain balance between 28 separate member countries. The truth about the EU is often very prosaic. The challenge, therefore, is trying to work out the truth from the deafening roar of nonsense.

If you have lived abroad for a long time or are the offspring of parents from different countries – like my kids are – you are likely to find the idea of tribal nationalism bizarre and the attractions of Europe obvious.

If you spend your life hopping across borders and speaking other languages you are likely to view proud, rooted, monolingual citizens of a region or country as somewhat provincial.

And if you are paid by the EU or earn your living feeding off it you are probably going to think the EU is a good thing.

I try to recreate that moment, using my memory or video, but it’s never the same – either I must improvise or I must accept that I can only find back 70% of the complexity.

70% of the complexity may be enough.

As of right now, the only people I see playing fast and loose with anti-Semites, xenophobes, homophobes, ultranationalists, fascists, neo-Nazis, or far-right outfits of any other description are the flinty, austerian sociopaths of Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin.

For it is not fascists that they are really afraid of. History shows how elites never have been. Churchill may have defeated Hitler, but in the choice between fascism and socialism in the Greek Civil War, he knew which side his pita was tzatziki’ed.

Rather, it is the sans culottes that makes elite blood run cold. And these days, it appears that the latter-day Jacobins of the Mediterranean are grabbing their pitchforks and sharpening the guillotines.

The fact is that the world is divided between users of the Macintosh computer and users of MS-DOS compatible computers. I am firmly of the opinion that the Macintosh is Catholic and that DOS is Protestant. Indeed, the Macintosh is counterreformist and has been influenced by the “ratio studiorum” of the Jesuits. It is cheerful, friendly, conciliatory, it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step to reach – if not the Kingdom of Heaven – the moment in which their document is printed. It is catechistic: the essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons. Everyone has a right to salvation.

DOS is Protestant, or even Calvinistic. It allows free interpretation of scripture, demands difficult personal decisions, imposes a subtle hermeneutics upon the user, and takes for granted the idea that not all can reach salvation. To make the system work you need to interpret the program yourself: a long way from the baroque community of revelers, the user is closed within the loneliness of his own inner torment.

The longer the visitor stands before these landscapes, the more it becomes clear that their realistically represented subjects are subordinate to their finely painted detailing and decentered arrangements. Like the painter working from her window in the sky, the viewer, virtually hypnotized by the city’s precise hues and resonant tones, becomes lost in the grids of color far below, and steps, as it were, into competing sensations of ascension, suspension, and compression.

(…) In “Whitney Museum Under Construction” (2013), the cantilevered crane and the rising beams of well-engineered gentrification are set against the streaking headlights that curve along the high speed, multicolored lanes of the West Side Highway. The Hudson River, painted in undulating blue, stretches calmly beyond the museum’s construction site, out into an expanse lit up only by arbitrarily positioned boats that themselves seem to be painting lines upon the currents as they cut through the water.

Weather for the blind is a live streaming site of a musical instrument which is played by the weather. The base station is called Weather Warlock and is currently streaming live from New Orleans. In the event that the home stream is down, you can check out the live stream of our “Upstate Warlock”, stationed at Wave Farm in Acra New York.

The weather sensors are mounted to a post and detect temperature, wind, sun, and rain. This all-analog synthesizer produces a wide range of tones and harmonics based around a consonant F major chord with special audio events occurring during sunrise and sunset. This instrument evolved from an earlier incarnation called “Weather Witch”, developed by Mars Brown and Quintron. The very first prototype was called “Singing House” which was debuted by N.O.Airlift in 2011.

The New York School poets made a big deal about art and artists, but there was only one photographer they abducted: Rudy Burckhardt.

(…) When the pictures started coming, they revealed a syncopated geometry slightly off the city grid. An early portrait of Denby on the roof of their building appears to have been taken from midair, the curious combination of perspective and flattened plane making the pedestrians below look at once perfectly normal and unsettlingly small. Subliminal illusions and affection for the askew lighten Burckhardt’s work from his earliest New York pieces, which highlight architectural details of doorways and uneven sidewalks. Burckhardt politely ignored the themes then dominating photography: his work wasn’t social commentary, and it wasn’t simply pretty, either.

Originally "Speculative Realism" was the title used to describe a specific constellation of topics - realism, materialism, and metaphysics - under discussion at a workshop held at the Goldsmiths College University of London in April of 2007.  Today, however, a new metaphysics - inspired by the "spirit" of speculative realism but also developing beyond it - is currently underway.  "The new materialism," "Continental realism," "the new metaphysics," or "the new realism" all have been used to designate new currents of metaphysics as practiced in the 21st century, largely (although not exclusively) within the Continental tradition.  I group these currents loosely under the broad title of contemporary "speculative philosophy."

A wide variety of names, most popularly Alain Badiou, Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, Francois Laruelle, Bruno Latour, Isabelle Stengers, Catherine Malabou, and Iain Hamilton Grant - along with many, many others - could be called synonymous with this new current of philosophy which has, in many ways, challenged what contemporary metaphysical philosophy might mean, especially since the philosophies of Kant and Hegel.  

Because this new metaphysics is still very much in a process of development, this guide's approach is pluralistic and porous, for without rigid or concrete borders to determinately "close" the shape of this new process of thought it would be premature to excise who or what may be engaged and encountered when it comes to contemporary metaphysical philosophy.  Thus, this guide offers the first tutorial of its kind in breadth, depth, and scope.  It approaches this new philosophy in a way that is non-hierarchical, invitational, and open-minded - being wary of any supposed "ownership" over "name brands."  In short, the purpose of this guide is more concerned with the ideas and concepts in question rather than specific names, brands, or titles.

I was working on a series of figures, in various media (copperplate, charcoal, silk-screen and acrylics), derived from headlamp-glare on the rain-soaked windscreen that absorbed my attention on a ten hour night-time bus journey from London to Edinburgh. The figure formed by light and rain on a moving screen reconstructed these physical elements as if constructing a four dimensional account of the dynamics of Kandinsky’s and Malevich’s most abstract compositions. This was the first move toward philosophy: abstraction and actuality are identical.

(…) If art had been for me the technique whereby the manipulability of reality was first demonstrated, philosophy now became a continuation of art by different means.

Through technology the world has become smaller; the states of the large peninsula of Europe appear today as close to each other as the cities of each small Mediterranean peninsula appeared in ancient times.

In the needs and experiences of every individual, based on his awareness of manifold of relations, Europe — one could almost say the world — already outlines itself as an element of unity.

It would consequently be a duty of the educated and well-meaning Europeans to at least make the attempt to prevent Europe — on account of its deficient organization as a whole — from suffering the same tragic fate as ancient Greece once did. Should Europe too gradually exhaust itself and thus perish from fratricidal war?

The struggle raging today will likely produce no victor; it will leave probably only the vanquished. Therefore, it seems not only good, but rather bitterly necessary that educated men of all nations marshall their influence such that — whatever the still uncertain end of the war may be — the terms of peace shall not become the wellspring of future wars.

Q: What would a just prison system look like to you?  
It’s complicated. Most of us in the 21st century abolitionist movement look to W.E.B. Du Bois’ critique about the abolition of slavery — that it was not enough simply to throw away the chains. The real goal was to re-create a democratic society that would allow for the incorporation of former slaves. [Prison abolition] would be about building a new democracy: substantive rights to economic sustenance, to healthcare; more emphasis on education than incarceration; creating new institutions that would tend to make prisons obsolete.  
Q: You think prisons won’t be necessary one day?  
It is possible, but even [if it doesn’t happen], we can move to a very different kind of justice that does not require a retributive impulse when someone does something terrible.

The railways that had helped Britain become an industrial power, but which were now haemorrhaging money, were to be cut back brutally. The car would replace the train, Beeching decreed. In doing so, he ushered in an era of vast motorway expansion and cheap motorised transport. The train, deemed dirty and smoky, was earmarked for extinction. If Beeching and other transport planners of the day had had their way, only a rump of inter-city lines would have been left.

Today the makeup of UK transport looks very different from the one envisaged by Dr Beeching. Rail passenger figures have almost doubled over the past 10 years; commuter trains are crammed; young people are deserting the car for the train; and Britain’s railway bosses are struggling to meet soaring demands for seats. The legacy of Beeching – dug-up lines, sold-off track beds and demolished bridges – has only hindered plans to revitalise the network, revealing the dangers of having a single, inflexible vision when planning infrastructure.

(…) Examples of the headaches imposed by Beeching’s legacy include the Varsity line that used to link Oxford and Cambridge and which the government now wants to reopen to connect fast-growing Milton Keynes with Oxbridge’s research centres. Rebuilding the disused western section between Oxford and Bedford will cost £270m and could be ready by 2017. But the track bed of the eastern section, between Bedford and Cambridge, was sold decades ago and has since been built on. How transport planners get round this problem remains to be seen.

But I am not Charlie. I cannot be Charlie as an Indian woman who has seen the sheer arrogance of Western rationalism in my own university. I cannot be Charlie because the freedom to dissent is never the same as the freedom to create racist caricatures from a position of relative privilege and power.

Which is why, as I mourn the horrific violence, I must also stand guard against the poverty of the good-vs-evil discourse. The slain are seldom unproblematic heroes. This however neither justifies their suffering nor for a second makes it okay to blame them for it. It simply means that we have to practice that same difficult freedom of reiterating unpleasant details and guard ourselves against the myth of martyrdom.

This panorama of the River Thames, engraved by Charles Vizetelly in 1844, was printed in four parts in the London illustrated newspaper Pictorial Weekly. “When readers joined the four parts together, the completed illustration extended to 14 feet in width,” writes the British Library, which has digitized the panorama in seven sections.

The illustration captures ten miles of river, including London landmarks like the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, as well as wharfs and warehouses that were sites of commerce and trade. (The Pictorial Weekly captioned the images with proud notes on that commerce: “[The Thames’] bosom bears the ships of all nations, freighted with the richest and rarest products of the earth.”) Tiny carriages and figures traverse the river’s bridges, and boats loaded with all manner of cargo pass by.

For middle-class people, therefore, the spectacle of the city is seen through car windows. If a painter were to paint this middle-class view, as, for instance, so many nineteenth-century painters tried to paint Paris from the perspective of its new, cosmopolitan boulevards, it would not, accordingly, be smooth or intimate. There would be no dwelling, like the Impressionists, on details of costume and gesture, no slow rendition of café light falling on pedestrian faces, no capturing of the almost unnoticeable interactions that happen between strangers in a public place. No, it would be a strobe-lit succession of unrelated glimpses: the covers of Vogue and Autocar flashing in front of the window as a magazine seller rushes between vehicles stopped at a traffic light, the wind-rushed hair of a woman and her child on the back of a speeding motorbike, the one eye of a stray dog caught in the headlights, the glinting instruments of a wedding band – and the whirl of the dancing procession, and the improbable white of the groom’s horse – the lipstick of a cluster of eunuchs pressing their faces to the window, the slump of a human form under a blanket on the highway’s central divide, a face in another car momentarily strip-lit as veering headlights dazzle the rear-view mirror – and a host of impressions of other, unformed characters, animal and human, whose identity it is difficult to discern.

‘An English Journey’ was an exhibition of photography and video by Andrew Cross. Alluding to J.B. Priestley’s pre-war state-of-the-nation travelogue, ‘English Journey’, Cross surveys a representative cross-section of contemporary England by retracing the path of the old A34 from Southampton through the Midlands to Manchester. A video, ‘3 Hours from Here’, shot from the cab of one of the many long-distance lorries that continue to ply their trade up and down the route of one of England’s main mercantile arteries, formed the centerpiece of the touring exhibition, which, starting in Southampton, also proceeded to Rugby and then to Manchester. For each venue, as an accompaniment to the video, Cross added a number of photographs, specific to each locality, finding moments of local colour in what many of us might all too easily dismiss as an inherently utilitarian and anonymous landscape.

There’s a historical sense, too, in which “culture” is a polemical word. In the nineteenth century, Williams explains, “culture” was often opposed to “civilization.” Civilization, the thinking went, was a homogenizing system of efficient, rational rules, designed to encourage discipline and “progress.” Culture was the opposite: an unpredictable expression of human potential for its own sake. (It’s for this reason that a term like “the culture industry” has an oxymoronic ring.) Today, we don’t often use the word “civilization”— we prefer to talk, more democratically, in terms of culture—but we’re still conflicted. We can’t help but notice how “civilized” life seems both to facilitate culture and to deaden it. Museums make it easy to see art, but they also weigh it down. Rock and roll sounds better in a club than in a concert hall. […] The most positive aspect of “culture”—the idea of personal, humane enrichment—now seems especially remote. In its place, the idea of culture as unconscious groupthink is ascendent.

Am Eingang [des Anti-Kriegs-Museums] stand ein Schild: “Eintritt für Menschen 20 Pfennig, für Soldaten frei”. Die Reichswehr fühlte sich beleidigt. Ernst Friedrich kam ins Gefängnis. Er hatte bald eine Stammzelle, in der er Strafen für derlei Delikte absaß.

Am Museumseingang hingen zwei Lampen, an einer Lampe ein deutscher Stahlhelm mit “Nie wieder”, an der anderen ein französischer mit “Plus jamais”. Die Stahlhelme waren umgedreht und dienten als Blumenampeln.

Es kam 1933. SA marschierte mit ruhig festem Schritt vor Ernst Friedrichs Museum und montierte von der Aufschrift das “Anti” ab. Nun hieß es “Kriegsmuseum”. Auf höheren Befehl machte man “Erstes Berliner Revolutionsmuseum der SA-Standarte 6, Berlin” daraus. Am 28. Februar wurde Ernst Friedrich verhaftet und ins Zuchthaus gesteckt.

Policies everywhere have become stricter since 1990. More importantly, the new study confirms earlier findings about the impact of individual measures: “an increase in stringency of environmental policies does not harm productivity growth.” This contradicts what most governments and companies seem to believe: that green rules may be justified by the need to save the planet but impose immediate economic costs. […] [The study] reckons that a shift from the lowest (Greek) levels of environmental stringency to the highest (Danish) ones further boosts productivity in the most productive manufacturing firms by 0.2-0.6%. But it reduces productivity, by 0.1-0.3%, in firms that were already less productive.

Abū ʿUthman ʿAmr ibn Baḥr al-Kinānī al-Baṣrī (Arabic: أبو عثمان عمرو بن بحر الكناني البصري‎), commonly known as al-Jāḥiẓ (Arabic: الجاحظ‎, bug eyes, born 776; died December 868/January 869) was an Arab prose writer and author of works of literature, Mu'tazili theology, and politico-religious polemics.

Ibn al-Nadim lists nearly 140 titles attributed to Al-Jahiz, of which 75 are extant. The best known are Kitāb al-Ḥayawān (The book of living), a seven-part compendium on an array of subjects with animals as their point of departure; Kitāb al-Bayān wa-l-tabyīn (The book of eloquence and exposition), a wide-ranging work on human communication; and Kitāb al-Bukhalāʾ (The book of misers), a collection of anecdotes on stinginess.

He is said to have been crushed to death under the weight of his own tomes.

The islands [the Laccadives and Maldives] are all planted with coconut palms, which closely resemble date palms but do not bear dates. Many scholars who have specialized in the growth of animals and the grafting of trees claim that the cocnut palm is nothing more than the palm called muql, which under the influence of the soil of India, where it was transplanted, was transformed into the coconut palm.

It feels bloated, not elegant. It swells towards the top, in celebration of the fact that floor space gets more valuable the higher you go. […] And here’s a suggestion for the 2015 election manifestos: whenever the word “iconic” is included in a planning application it should be substituted with “whooshy”. Then we’ll see how many officers and inspectors can, with a straight face, permit towers like this.

While joining Coursera’s “community” does not resemble a job in the “getting paid” aspect of things, it does require you to sign a “Translator Agreement,” which makes clear that the relationship between Coursera and members of the GTC is subject to employment law insofar as it ensures Coursera’s complete and perpetual ownership of value produced by employees — or rather, “volunteers” — but in every other respect, it is not a job, just a way to be nice.

Coursera’s GTC offers the clearest instance yet of an emerging labor force in digital capitalism, which I suggest we call the voluntariat.

The voluntariat performs skilled work that might still command a wage without compensation, allegedly for the sake of the public good, regardless of the fact that it also contributes directly and unambiguously to the profitability of a corporation. Like the proletariat, then, the voluntariat permits the extraction of surplus value through its labor.

(…) Internships have made work more like non-work by uncoupling it from the expectation of wages. Social media has made non-work more like work by permitting the commodification of spheres of activity previously never conceived of as labor. The emergence of the voluntariat follows logically from both of these developments.

Linguists are most excited by what MLE is doing to the rhythm of speech. English is usually spoken with a stress-timed rhythm, in which syllables are stressed at regular intervals. Speakers of MLE speak with a syllable-timed rhythm, in which all syllables are accorded roughly the same time and stress, as in French or Japanese. Syllable-timed speech is a characteristic of languages that have come into contact with other languages. Versions of it may have existed in multicultural places such as Hackney for centuries, thinks Mr Kerswill.

Sur un autre plan, on pourrait tout à fait voir dans cette nouvelle un simple retour à la logique. Lorsque Diderot et d’Alembert conçurent l’Encyclopédie, ils imaginèrent d’abord une nouvelle organisation du savoir. Une organisation collaborative, où les auteurs étaient nombreux, une organisation cyclique, où les entrées renvoyaient les unes aux autres, et en mouvement continuel où les articles évoluaient à mesure qu’évoluaient les objets, techniques et savoirs, dont il était question.

Cette nouvelle organisation du savoir trouva place dans le livre parce qu’il n’y avait rien d’autre pour en assurer la diffusion. Son succès, et le rôle historique qu’eut l’Encyclopédie, à la fois en termes pédagogiques et politiques, disent bien que ce fut une œuvre extraordinaire. Mais, d’emblée, c’était aller à l’encontre de toutes les ambitions du projet que de le faire entrer dans un support lourd, fixe et épais comme le livre.

Comme aime à l’expliquer le chercheur suisse Frédéric Kaplan, que l’encyclopédie soit un livre est un accident de l’Histoire, l’encyclopédie a toujours excédé le livre, elle était coincée dans le livre, qui en faisait un objet un peu absurde. Des énormes volumes, des index compliqués à manier, et surtout une caducité très rapide de nombreux articles qui nécessitaient des volumes de réactualisation rendant encore plus compliqué le maniement. Puis vint le Web.

What is clearer to me, however, is that we have projected the ironies and insecurities and indeterminacies of Postmodernism back onto Romanticism; we have reinvented the Romantics into our own image (which, incidentally, is the other side of the “anxiety of influence”–I mean absorption, assimilation).

Certain topics or problems or figures, however, do run from Romanticism, through Modernism, to Postmodernism, mutating all the while. For instance, Romantic Imagination becomes Modernist Consciousness becomes Postmodernist Language–from Imagination to Language, as master tropes. And the Romantic Self becomes the Modernist Ego becomes the Postmodernist empty Subject, itself a Discourse. But these are largely French conceits: try to tell the Self or the Ego or the Subject or your child, for that matter, that its imperious needs are a form of absence, dissemination, or deferral.

(…) I have come to distrust abstractions, especially bloodied abstractions (to misquote Wallace Stevens); that is, abstractions that demand human blood to maintain them for a higher end. No!

(…) “Cultural residue” is fine, but I am impressed by the infinite differences within a class, a race, a gender, a family even. We are “constructed” to an indefinite degree, but we also construct back. Chance and biology, self-creation and social influences, all play a part. Strict “constructionists,” who tend to be determinists, can accuse others and exonerate themselves in the same cry. Obviously, this has great appeal, therapeutic and theological appeal.

(…) Q: Indulge me in a Gedankenexperiment: suppose, if you will, that we lived in a culture where any literary-critical act, spoken or written, were taboo–the equivalent to, say, publicly discussing in detail one’s sexual preferences or experiences. What would such a culture be like? Would a kind of underground criticism emerge? Would the culture be diminished by the absence of public voices of criticism?

IH: A Gedankenexperiment deserves another. We would get what I call Angelic Criticism, angelic reading of texts: total identification with texts, in silence. Or, if you wish, [Pierre] Menardian Criticism: rewriting the text in identical words. It would be better, wouldn’t it, than the class that begins every “discussion” with, “Now, what’s wrong with this book?”

Allan Sekula, who had grown up in the Los Angeles harbour town of San Pedro, was learning that the maritime world, far from being a realm of pleasure cruises and play, was riven by struggle and class conflict. Since then much of his extraordinary body of experimental work has been devoted to chronicling the social, economic and political dynamics of life on the oceans. His latest exercise in hydropoetics, a cine-essay entitled The Forgotten Space that he co-directed with Noël Burch, uses the statistic that 90% of cargoes today are carried by ship as its cue to develop a wide-ranging thesis about containerisation, globalisation and invisible labour.

(…) “The sea is all about slow time – things move slowly, there’s a lot of waiting – and as such it contradicts all the mythologies of instantaneity perpetuated by electronic media.”

While his photographic work has sought to renew the documentary tradition, Sekula’s practice as a theorist and historian of photography has been equally crucial to his search for a way beyond the habitual lapse of the discourse of documentary into either a scientistic objectivism or a romantic and expressive subjectivism. Sekula stands as one of very few contemporary artists – matched only, perhaps, by his early interlocutor Martha Rosler – to have continually and convincingly resisted the conventional division of labour between practitioner and critic.

(…) [T]he renewed attention to the economic subject in Fish Story ­may be considered as a challenge not only to the shortcomings of an embodied identity politics. Sekula’s project also contested the concealment of the world of production by the art world’s attachment to the fatalistic orthodoxy of a ‘simulationist’ world of endless, autonomous image-proliferation.

(…) The counterpart, then, to the familiar post-industrial and postmodern visions of social reproduction founded on service labour, the creative industries and the fashioning of consumer experiences in the advanced societies of the North has been the ebbing visibility of material production over the last thirty to forty years in those same countries. While commodity chains have proliferated exponentially, their links have become both more numerous and more fragile as a result of such trends as the dissociation of brand ownership from factory ownership, and the relocation of factory work to ad hoc, clandestine Export Processing Zones in the global South as well as subterranean sweatshops in the North. One significant consequence of this has been the expansion of an ever larger industrial labour pool for capital’s ever more itinerant hand to grasp, and the rapid growth of a global reserve army of labour; an underpaid ‘precariat’ whose insecurity is the flipside to the cherished autonomy of the cosmopolitan freelancer.”

But government works in strange ways in Myanmar: Many decisions are made on an ad hoc basis, and developers are looking for cheap insider deals as the economy goes through a rough transition. There is no legal framework for protection of the buildings, and no discussion of how to protect the people who have been living in hallways, towers and hidden back rooms.

(…) At the heart of the plan will be the idea that downtown Yangon should retain its vibrancy rather than become another sanitized zone that appeals to well-to-do tourists impressed by expensive hotels and tony cafes, Mr. Thant Myint-U said. To preserve a sense of authenticity, he said, there will be efforts to keep residents in some of the buildings, perhaps with subsidized rents, and to limit the number of big, impersonal international hotels that attract foreign visitors but are off-limits to most locals.

In one sense, then, the real is connected to trauma, and in another sense to matter. But these aren’t really two separate categories. For Freud, psychic trauma is a material phenomenon, since all mental existence is material: in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, he defines the organism – human or otherwise – as being, at root, ‘an undifferentiated vesicle of a substance that is susceptible to stimulation’. The central nervous system is an ‘ectoderm’ or outside skin that serves as ‘an organ for receiving stimuli’ or ‘excitatory traces’.

The crisis in journalism is a business crisis, and it’s been going on for twenty years; the outcome remains far from obvious. Writers and editors at magazines and newspapers live with a perpetual sense of foreboding, which leads to plummeting self-confidence in their own work and a tendency to overestimate the new digital enterprises, or the new digitally rich owners of the old enterprises. It’s easy to feel that the very task of reporting and writing in depth, at length, and in complex detail is somehow to blame for their problems. It isn’t—but, faced with a deeply uncertain future, they become, in a phrase from Robert Stone’s novel “A Flag for Sunrise,” the mouse so scared it went to the cat for love.”

Blogging, as “casual” theory production, is much closer to this contemporary process of taking and transmitting photographs than, let’s say, writing an academic essay. But still it is not the same. The only thing that would come really close would be permanently recording oneself and others with a Dictaphone and immediately uploading it onto YouTube—something that, strangely, we are not normally doing, as if what we said to each other at that lovely evening with friends was less important, and easier to remember, than how we were dressed.”

One of the advantages of living in Europe is that I get birthday greetings from the German president, Wulff, and the Spanish prime minister, Rajoy, neither of whom I know. After being at each other’s throats for years in fratricidal wars, we’re now all culturally European.

(…) That’s the way it is. Back when Pope Wojtyla was still alive, there was much discussion on whether they should accept the European constitution and the continent’s Christian roots. Secular people predominated and they did nothing about it. The church protested. There was however a third way, more difficult, but one that would give us strength today.

And that would have been to speak of the constitution of all our roots – the Greek-Roman, the Judaic and the Christian. In our past, we have both Venus and the crucifix, the Bible and Nordic mythology, which we remember with Christmas trees, or with the many festivals of St Lucy, St Nicolas and Santa Claus. Europe is a continent that was able to fuse many identities, and yet not confuse them.

That is precisely how I see its future. As for religion: be careful. Many people who no longer go to church end up falling prey to supersitition. And many who are non-practising still carry around a little saint card with a picture of Padre Pio in their wallets!

(…) And since Pierre Bayard is right, we know there are books we have yet to read that will help us reflect on cultures different from our own. Little by little: that is how our European identity will become more profound.”

“When I say “violence in white gloves”, I don’t mean the Mafia has become more lenient or that it faces any qualms of conscience. I mean the Mafia uses its economic power – enabled by financial markets that allow too many grey areas and too many tax havens – to strangle people, not physically, but in terms of their livelihoods. As the number of dead bodies diminishes, the number of living dead grows. There are many people in Italy who have had their job, hope and dignity removed by the Mafia.”

Beckett’s scorings tend to occur in clusters, but perhaps this tells us as much, if not more, about Proust’s method as about Beckett’s, for even the most devoted Proustian would admit that there are dull stretches on the long road we have to travel. Beckett refrains from such evidence of frustration as one is used to from his notebooks — the squiggles of Byzantine complexity, the doodles that throw up weird human figures — but there are a number of rather blank periods, especially in Le côté de Guermantes but also in ‘Un amour de Swann’ (except for the section concerned with music) and quite frequently in Sodome et Gomorrhe where Beckett has obviously found little to interest him.”

When Honoré Daumier died in 1879, blind and penniless in a borrowed cottage, with few paintings sold and nearly all of his incomparable cartoons fading inside old French newspapers, the tributes put as much weight on his character as his art. “A man of genius and honesty,” said one; “an artist of conviction and a true republican” said another. His modesty, grace and generosity were praised.

One might have expected more about his radical freedom as a painter, the beauty of his draughtsmanship – Picasso would later compare him to Michelangelo – or the originality of his satire. But he was remembered as a friend of the poor, among whom he was too uncomplaining ever to class himself, and as the unwavering voice of the people.

It is only on seeing the Royal Academy’s long-awaited show that one realises how completely these qualities in fact characterise the work. No matter how subversive the lampoon, how bitter the tragedy, how dark the Paris drama, the abiding sense is of the artist’s boundless empathy.

Collection comprises the entirety of William Gedney's photographic career, beginning with his student years at Pratt Institute in the 1950s to his early death in 1989. The materials reveal Gedney's intense and meticulous dedication to his work, and his interest in street photography, portraiture, night photography, and the study of human nature. His earliest serious project was undertaken in Kentucky, where he stayed with a coal-miner's family for several weeks in 1964 and again in 1972. His work took him across the U.S. several times, with extensive photographic projects in Chicago, Detroit, Pennsylvania, South Dakota - particularly the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation, and southern and northern California. During these trips, as well as in New York City, he also photographed well-known composers. Fascinated by human group dynamics, he photographed parades, hippies and other street people, and crowds. He also traveled to Kolkata (Calcutta) and Varanasi (Benares), India, England, Ireland, Paris, and Amsterdam. The collection offers roughly 76,000 unique images represented by the over 2000 contact sheets, with over 19,000 selected images in the form of work prints and 1466 exhibit-quality large prints.

In the first case, not very much context is required because Western art is supposed to be universal, transcending national or geographic differences. It is Art. But Asian art is not Art, but ‘Asian art’, and therefore an informed understanding of the various contexts in which it is produced is essential for doing it full justice; it is always tied to its time and place. So, an Indian photographer cannot depict loss, absence or fear, but must always represent poverty-stricken and spiritualist, or liberalized and industrializing, India (suitably Bollywoodized). We hardly ever have books, photobook introductions or catalogue essays explaining what is Belgian, French, Canadian or American about Belgian, French, Canadian or American photography, because we can respond to Belgian, French, Canadian or American photographs as we respond to the Venus de Milo or Mona Lisa, without having to know about Classical Greece or Renaissance Italy.

But not so with Asian photography. An entirely different approach to knowing, understanding and looking has to be constructed, mastered, disseminated and repeatedly invoked in order to bring such a category into the global field of vision. And this applies to not only those who are looking at it, showing it, collecting it and writing about it, but also to those who are making it. That is, Asian photographers themselves often end up internalizing this way of seeing and start producing work for it, and from within it, presenting their work, in books and in shows, according to its requirements. They readily accept the contexts in which their work is invariably read, and then start perpetuating those readings of their work and the assumptions that inform these readings.

They end up producing work that could be written about, shown and taught within what has turned into readymade frames and perspectives. Non-Asia looks at Asia in a certain way, and therefore Asia also looks at, and projects, itself in that way. In the earlier centuries, this was called colonialism or imperialism; Edward Said had called it Orientalism. Now it is called Context, and the right-minded, well-intentioned, academically respectable sound of the word obscures the structures of commerce, knowledge and power that constitute this primacy of Context.

I inhabit a deep contradiction. I feel like an exile in the face of the growing Jewish ethnicisation that surrounds me, while at the same time the language in which I speak, write and dream is overwhelmingly Hebrew. When I find myself abroad, I feel nostalgia for this language, the vehicle of my emotions and thoughts. When I am far from Israel, I see my street corner in Tel Aviv and look forward to the moment I can return to it. I do not go to synagogues to dissipate this nostalgia, because they pray there in a language that is not mine, and the people I meet there have absolutely no interest in understanding what being Israeli means for me.

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance.

The problem with Banach-Tarski is that we tend to think of it less in mathematical terms, and more in concrete terms. It’s often described as something like “You can slice up an orange, and then re-assemble it into two identical oranges“. Or “you can cut a baseball into pieces, and re-assemble it into a basketball.” Those are both obviously ridiculous. But they’re ridiculous because they violate one of our instinct that derives from the conservation of mass. You can’t turn one apple into two apples: there’s only a specific, finite amount of stuff in an apple, and you can’t turn it into two apples that are identical to the original. But math doesn’t have to follow conservation of mass in that way. A sphere doesn’t have a mass. It’s just an uncountably infinite set of points with a particular collection of topological relationship and geometric relationships.

More specifically, the term refers to films that are influenced by the form and structure of a musical symphony, although it is debatable as to how many of the films labelled as city symphonies conform to this pattern. Indeed, the city symphony tag is so slippery that it’s questionable whether even its most famous example – Man with a Movie Camera (1929) – is a true city symphony.

Movie Camera is famous for presenting a dazzling portrayal of urban city life, but when considered as part of the genre, the film is a cheat: it was actually shot in three different Ukrainian cities (Odessa, Kharkiv and Kiev) so, while as a piece of film-making it is magnificent (it was recently voted the greatest documentary of all time by Sight & Sound), it is arguable that the film’s concoction of a Ukrainian super-city robs us of one of the greatest joys of the genre: that of seeing a specific city as it was.

Die Situation ist paradox. Denn mit der Blutsversessenheit übernehmen die Stämme die Kategorien der Kolonisten. Es war die US-Regierung, die sich im Laufe des 19. Jahrhunderts darauf versteift hat, dass Indianertum eine Frage des Blutes sei. Aus dieser Zeit stammen auch pseudowissenschaftliche Begriffe wie das Halbblut.

If we watch stuff like The Riot Club we bend the knee to a lucrative global industry that has a dual function. Internationally, selling posh abroad (think: Downton Abbey, The Kings Speech, The Queen) has helped reduce the balance of payments deficit that resulted when the industries in which the working classes toiled were eliminated by the Conservative governments of the 1980s. And domestically? Selling posh helps reduce us to voyeurs of a pimped-up grotesquerie of toffs behaving badly.

And she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    now

She is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it lose  
And gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring up  
Its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she fell  
Into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge  
Into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    saving

And then the queen passed close to me and I stared at her. I am ashamed now to say it but I passed my eyes over her as a cannibal views his dinner, my gaze sharp enough to pick the meat off her bones.

(…) She looked young: for a moment she had turned back from a figurehead into the young woman she was, before monarchy froze her and made her a thing, a thing which only had meaning when it was exposed, a thing that existed only to be looked at.

But, critically, furnishing weaponry always implies a choice of fighters to pull the trigger. This in turn has historically required an effort to identify and categorise certain groups, often – though not always – “minorities” like the Kurds, as distinctively reliable, martial proxies. Who gets the guns, and on what basis, is therefore the key question.

We are sitting in a long, low room beneath the eaves. Atkinson has sent his wife to bed. He himself is busy sharpening some tools at a little oilstone, smoking one of my cigars the while.  
The air seems charged with thunder. I am writing this at a shaky table before the open window. The leg is cracked, and Atkinson, who seems a handy man with his tools, is going to mend it as soon as he has finished putting an edge on his chisel.  
It is after eleven now. I shall be gone in less than an hour.  
But the heat is stifling.  
It is enough to send a man mad.

People in Timbuktu either adapt or leave. As the canal dried up and the winds of rain increasingly brought dust, Mahamane Alphady’s father – “or it could have been my grandfather” – dug a hole. So did all the other market gardeners, creating dozens of craters that fed on the canal’s run-off water. Vegetables grew on their walls. But every year they had to dig deeper. In 1973, his father gave up.

This site is devoted to collecting the kind of unusual English spellings that have come to be called eggcorns. Eggcorn, the word, is a coinage that goes back to the excellent Language Log. The About page retraces the history of the term and offers more information on how this site came to be.

The Eggcorn Database went public on February 15, 2005. It is a collaborative site in the sense that several contributors have access to it.

Sie [im IS] wissen, dass wir im Westen das, was sie ins Netz stellen, kaum herausfiltern können. Die Brutalität ist nichts Neues, das Neue drückt sich in den medialen Mitteln aus. Was der IS betreibt, ist keine klassische Propaganda mehr. Das, was ins Netz gestellt wird, ist in der Regel jedenfalls nicht gefälscht — es ist ein Abbild der Wirklichkeit.

Balthus is a difficult artist. Obnoxious. Cheesy. Stiff. Yet by fusing conservative technique with surreal setups and subject matter drawn from the deep reservoirs of sadomasochistic imagery and erotica, his painting is a world apart. I don’t love Balthus’s work, but I grant that all parts of the best examples are charged with something wild, almost half-human, some sleeping need, rage, frustration, and restraint.

La réalisation de Feuillade est très soignée. Le film est très rythmé, si bien qu’on ne voit pas passer les cinquante minutes de bobines.  L’ambiance que Feuillade met en place est tout simplement géniale et envoûtante. On pénètre ici dans le Paris du début du XXème siècle et on en découvre les aspects les plus mystérieux et les plus sordides. Le tout est couronné par une musique somptueuse parfois terrifiante, parfois drôle et souvent envoûtante et entraînante.

Vous l’aurez compris, avec *Fantômas : A l’ombre de la guillotine*, on assiste à l’émergence d’un immense talent qu’est celui de Louis Feuillade. Il faut préciser que le style du réalisateur né également des détails scénaristiques (je rappelle que le scénario est rédigé par Feuillade lui-même qui se base sur le roman de Souvestre et d’Allain).

I did escape. Thank the God who definitely didn’t write the Good News Bible, I did, eventually, escape. I didn’t get my youth back. No one can give you your youth back. But in the process of finding a faith and losing it, I did learn an awful lot. I learned, for example, that almost anyone can believe almost anything, and that arguing with them probably won’t change their mind. I learned that you can take a great work of literature – packed with stories, poetry and images that have shaped the face of western art – and turn it into something not just dangerous but banal.

The banam is a stringed instrument. Banams are the lutes and the fiddles of the Santal people. They are made from locally available material–wood, vegetables and animal hide. The most common banams still made and played by Santals are the Dhodro Banam, the Reta Banam and the Phentor Banam.

Ever since the 1970s we’ve been in a situation of what I’d call wage repression in which real wages didn’t really rise at all. But that led to problems in the market. If you restrict wages you have a problem with aggregate demand. One way that problem was solved was by giving working people credit cards and allowing them to go into debt. Household debt in the US has tripled in the last 20 years or so.

L’urbanisation du pays est, cependant, anarchique. Les quartiers de yourtes s’y multiplient, notamment dans la banlieue de la capitale où la population nomade fraîchement arrivée installe sa demeure circulaire en l’entourant d’une palissade, sans que pour autant les infrastructures urbaines et les installations nécessaires à un confort, ne serait-ce que rudimentaire, soient présentes. Aujourd’hui, plus de la moitié des habitants n’ont pas accès à l’eau courante et le quotidien s’organise entre allers-retours aux rares puits privés et kiosques à eau et passages hebdomadaires aux bains publics. L’urbanisation rapide de certaines régions de la Mongolie a entraîné, en effet, une réduction de la disponibilité de l’eau pour l’usage domestique et industriel et de grandes difficultés d’assainissement, à Oulan-Bator notamment.

Vivre dans cette ville, c’est aussi affronter la pollution atmosphérique de ses faubourgs, dans la mesure où les familles se chauffent encore majoritairement au charbon en hiver en raison de la proximité des mines. Enfin, toujours en lien avec cette urbanisation mal maîtrisée, la plupart des déchets ne sont pas traités sur place mais par des déchetteries aux abords de la ville qui ne font que rassembler les détritus. Aucune mesure d’envergure n’a été décidée à ce sujet afin qu’une prise en charge du problème soit assurée en termes environnementaux, mais aussi sanitaires, du fait du risque d’épidémies.

All those headlines about runaway prices and impossible rents: John Wilkes House is where you see the human fallout. A meltdown happens daily here: one that’s forced the council to experiment with a string of new, unusual and highly risky interventions in its housing market. Many of its policies are untried. Some are radical enough to startle even the experts.

Just a few miles away from Westminster, Enfield’s local politicians are making a series of gambles that parliament’s big beasts wouldn’t dare try. They come with serious political and economic risk. But if even some of the things being tried by Enfield work out, they might help not only cases such as Christina’s, but also point to some radical solutions to Britain’s housing crisis.

If all this suggests that I’m letting my ‘rapist’ off comparatively lightly, that is partly because in the intervening years the retelling of this story (to myself as much as to other people) has generated quite other interpretations of what went on, which coexist – and compete – with the account I’ve just given.

(…) But what is really objectionable about the book has very little to do with its gender politics, much more with its arrogant scientism and messianic zeal for evolutionary biology as the key to unlock the whole of world culture, backed up by the shoddiest of arguments.

(…) I have to admit that I have long been suspicious of any argument that starts with a chimp and ends with a human being; and I may, for this reason alone, be an unsuitably prejudiced commentator on any study in evolutionary biology.
